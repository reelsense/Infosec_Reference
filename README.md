# Infosec_Reference

An Information Security Reference That Doesn't Suck


#### Goal:
* Be an awesome Information Security Reference
* List of techinques, tools and tactics to learn from/reference.
* Something like a "Yellow Pages" in the sense of you know something exists, but what was it called....
* End goal: Rich resource of infosec knowledge for anyone to browse through as a jumping off point for various niches OR as a reference/recall method for stuff.
* Something similar to the [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Main_Page) (eventually; As in, "I want to do priv esc on OS X, what methods are there?" or, "I'm studying UAFs, is there any good info I can look at without diving deep?" Focused on performing attacks and how they're done vs how attacks are done with a focus on defense - D3f3ns3 Framework?)
* Always accepting more links/stuff. Feel free to contribue or suggest something.

* Little extra something: ALL LINKS LISTED ARE VALID. They will route to their target page or to Internet Archives most recent archive of that page. All links are validated when I pull from github and host on my site using Daux. 

#### Why Do *I* Care?
* No idea. I do this as a resource for myself and offer it publicly as a way of giving back to the general community.

#### Why Do *You* Care?
* Don't have to constantly google for tools/reminder. 
* Easily browsable list of tools, techniques, papers, and research in all sorts of areas.


##### This page
* Nicer UI [rmusser.net/docs](https://rmusser.net/docs)
* For latest content updates, check here: [Things added since last update](https://github.com/rmusser01/Infosec_Reference/blob/master/Draft/things-added.md)
...* This will have all links added to the other pages sorted according to topic, making it easier to see new stuff.


* This page is terrible. It should not be used to navigate for info unless you like self harm. Use [https://rmusser.net/docs](https://rmusser.net/docs]) instead.

* More content is within the Draft folder. The below is broken(probably).
