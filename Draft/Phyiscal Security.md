* We all know that Hollywood has a difficult time portraying hackers accurately. This quirk often extends to the realm of showing lockpicking in movies and on TV. But sometimes, a film gets it really right! This talk is both an introduction to lockpicking (in case you still need to learn) as well as a walk through some of the best - and some of the worst - scenes of lockpicking that have ever been seen by movie and TV audiences. Learn about how to be a better lockpicker and a better filmmaker... all at the same time!

[Lockpicking, Safecracking, & More by Deviant Ollam & renderman at ShmooCon 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTgUVhjts2U)
* For the first time on the same stage together at ShmooCon, renderman and i give a funny and informative presentation about lockpicking using much of my traditional material as well as a whole load of new content that my favorite Canadian demonstrates. In addition to his all-around general badassery, renderman even opened up a locked safe on stage... one that he had never seen before and was simply given by an audience member. That took fucking balls.

[The Search for the Perfect Door - Deviant Ollam - Shakacon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYvBLAF4T8)
* You have spent lots of money on a high-grade, pick-resistant, ANSI-rated lock for your door. Your vendor has assured you how it will resist attack and how difficult it would be for someone to copy your key. Maybe they’re right. But… the bulk of attacks that both penetration testers and also criminals attempt against doors have little or nothing to do with the lock itself! This talk will be a hard-hitting exploration (full of photo and video examples) of the ways in which your door — the most fundamental part of your physical security — can possibly be thwarted by someone attempting illicit entry. The scary problems will be immediately followed by simple solutions that are instantly implementable and usually very within-budget. You, too, can have a near-perfect door… if you’re willing to learn and understand the problems that all doors tend to have.

[Electronic Locks - are really secure?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK0MfE7o4HU)
* Many people are familiar with the ways in which mechanical locks can be attacked, compromised, and bypassed. Indeed, the hands-on workshops and the availability of pick tools at the Lockpick Village is an enduring part of the fun at DeepSec and other popular security conferences around the world. Often, attendees will ask questions like, "So, this is really great... but what if someone is using an electronic lock? How hard is it to open the door, then?" Unfortunately, due to time and space constraints, our answer is typically, "Well... that's a very complicated question. Sometimes they're good, and sometimes they're weak." We often promise greater detail another day, another time... but until now that time has not come. Finally now, however, TOOOL will describe some of the most popular electronic locks and show examples of how they can sometimes be attacked.

[Home Insecurity: No Alarms, False Alarms, and SIGINT](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2022/DEF%20CON%2022%20presentations/Logan%20Lamb/DEFCON-22-Logan-Lamb-HOME-INSECURITY-NO-ALARMS-FALSE-ALARMS-AND-SIGINT-WP.pdf)
* The market share of home security systems has substantially increased as vendors incorporate more desirable features: intrusion detection, automation, wireless, and LCD touch panel controls. Wireless connectivity allows vendors to manufacture cheaper, more featureful products that require little to no home modification to install.  Consumer win, since adding devices is easier. The result: an ostensibly more secure, convenient, and connected home for a larger number of citizens. Sadly, this hypothesis is flawed; the idea of covering a home with more security sensors does not translate into a more secure home.  Additionally, the number of homes using these vulnerable systems is large, and the growth rate is increasing producing a even larger problem. In this paper, we will demonstrate a generalized approach for compromising three systems: ADT, the largest home security dealer in North America; Honeywell, one of the largest manufacturers of security devices; and Vivint, a top 5 security dealer.  We will suppress alarms, create false alarms, and collect artifacts that facilitate tracking the movements of individuals in their homes
