[Rocking the Pocket Book: Hacking Chemical Plant for Competition and Extortion - Marina Krotofil - Jason Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL8L76n0Q9w)
* The appeal of hacking a physical process is dreaming about physical damage attacks lighting up the sky in a shower of goodness. Let’s face it, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Vinyl Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack, from start to end, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack. Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the hands of a few. To help the community mastering new skills we have developed „Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process“ – first open source framework for cyber-physical experimentation based on two realistic models of chemical plants. Come to the session and take your first master class on complex physical hacking.

[ICS Security Assessment Methodology, Tools & Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WoA9SYLDoM)
* Dale Peterson of Digital Bond describes how to perform an ICS / SCADA cyber security assessment in this S4xJapan video.  He goes into a lot of detail on the tools and how to use them in the fragile and insecure by design environment that is an ICS.  There are also useful tips on when to bother applying security patches (this will likely surprise you), the importance of identifying the impact of a vulnerability, and an efficient risk reduction approach.

[Hacking Mainframes; Vulnerabilities in applications exposed over TN3270 - Dominic White](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t217-hacking-mainframes-vulnerabilities-in-applications-exposed-over-tn3270-dominic-white)
* IBM System Z Mainframes are in regular use in Fortune 500 companies. Far from being legacy these systems are running an actively maintained operating system (z/OS). Applications on these often occupy roles critical to the business processes they underpin, with much of the later technology built around them, rather than replacing them. However, these systems are often bypassed by security testing due to worried of availability or assumptions about legacy. This talk will introduce you to assessing mainframe applications, which turn out to be quite similar to web applications. For this purpose we built a tool, Big Iron Recon & Pwnage (BIRP), to assist with performing such assessments. Importantly, our research uncovered a family of mainframe application vulnerabilities introduced by the TN3270 protocol. We found numerous applications, but not all, vulnerable to these flaws. Applications running within the two most popular transaction managers (CICS and IMS) as well as one of IBM’s own applications. The tool released assists with the exploitation of these flaws.

* OPC UA binary protocol implementation is quasi complete and has been tested against many different OPC UA stacks. API offers both a low level interface to send and receive all UA defined structures and high level classes allowing to write a server or a client in a few lines. It is easy to mix high level objects and low level UA calls in one application.

[UaExpert—A Full-Featured OPC UA Client](https://www.unified-automation.com/products/development-tools/uaexpert.html)
* The UaExpert® is a full-featured OPC UA Client demonstrating the capabilities of our C++ OPC UA Client SDK/Toolkit. The UaExpert is designed as a general purpose test client supporting OPC UA features like DataAccess, Alarms & Conditions, Historical Access and calling of UA Methods. The UaExpert is a cross-platform OPC UA test client programmed in C++. It uses the sophisticated GUI library QT form Nokia (formerly Trolltech) forming the basic framework which is extendable by Plugins.
