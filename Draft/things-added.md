### ATT&CK

* [macOS High Sierra 10.13.1 insecure cron system](https://m4.rkw.io/blog/macos-high-sierra-10131-insecure-cron-system.html)
	* Easy root

* [OS X El Capitan - Sinking the S\H/IP - Stefan Esser - Syscan360 - 2016](https://www.syscan360.org/slides/2016_SG_Stefan_Esser_OS_X_El_Capitan_Sinking_The_SHIP.pdf)

	* Did you know that Macs contain a secondary OS that sits hidden besides OS X? This talk will initially dive into technical details of the Recovery OS, before showing that while on (newer) native hardware Apple verifies this OS, in virtualized environments this may not be the case. Due to this 'flaw' we'll describe how an attacker can infect a virtualized OS X instance with malware that is able to survive a full OS X restore. Though limited to virtual instances, such malware can also abuse this process install itself into SIP'd locations making disinfection far more difficult. It's also worth noting that this attack likely would succeed on older versions of non-virtualized OS X as well.

* [NotQuite0DayFriday](https://github.com/grimm-co/NotQuite0DayFriday)
	* This repository documents real bugs in real software. At the time of disclosure the most recent versions were patched. Seeing mistakes that were made in the past can be a useful tool for seeing trends of bugs which make it past all the quality control processes. Understanding what happened, is the first step to figuring out how to detect these issues in other software. The repo is organized by the release date. In each folder you will find instructions on how to trigger the bug, versions affected, and a stack trace at the time of the crash. It'll also contain any notes on the bug which might include things like references to specific lines of source code.

## Red Team/Adversary Simulation/Pentesting 


[emptynest](https://github.com/empty-nest/emptynest)
* Emptynest is a plugin based C2 server framework. The goal of this project is not to replace robust tools such as Empire, Metasploit, or Cobalt Strike. Instead, the goal is to create a supporting framework for quickly creating small, purpose built handlers for custom agents. No agent is provided. Users of Emptynest should create their own agents that implement minimal functionality and can be used to evade detection and establish a more robust channel. An example of an agent might support Unhooking, DLL Unloading, and code execution. Due to the simple nature of this project, it is recommended that agents be kept private.

EggShell gives you the power and convenience of uploading/downloading files, taking pictures, location tracking, shell command execution, persistence, escalating privileges, password retrieval, and much more. Server communication features end to end encryption with 128 bit AES and the ability to handle multiple clients. This is a proof of concept pentest tool, intended for use on machines you own.
