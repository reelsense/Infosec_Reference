[Detecting BadBIOS, Evil Maids, Bootkits and Other Firmware Malware - Paul English and Lee Fisher](https://archive.org/details/seagl-2017)
* For attackers, platform firmware is the new Software. Most systems include hundreds of firmwares - UEFI or BIOS, PCIe expansion ROMs, USB controller drivers, storage controller host and disk/SSD drivers. Firmware-level hosted malware, bare-metal or virtualized, is nearly invisible to normal security detection tools, has full control of your system, and can often continue running even when the system is "powered off". Security Firms (eg, "Hacking Team" sell UEFI 0days to the highest bidder), and government agencies include firmware-level malware (eg, Wikileak'ed Vault7 CIA EFI malware). Defenders need to catch-up, and learn to defend their systems against firmware-level malware. In this presentation, we'll cover the NIST SP (147,147b,155,193) secure firmware guidance, for citizens, rather than vendors/enterprises. We'll discuss the problem of firmware-level malware, and cover some open source tools (FlashROM, CHIPSEC, etc.) to help detect malware on your system. We'll be discussing a new open source tool we've just released to help make it easier for you to do this check. You'll also get a nice paper tri-fold copy of our CHIPSEC Quick Reference for Sysadmins [note: we're all sysadmins for our own personal systems(!)], and some scary looking BadBIOS stickers for your laptop.

*  In this talk, I'll provide a window into the warchest my team used to generate over a million lines of code. In particular, we created and used game hacks to process data from tens of millions of hours of in-game data and use the results to generate copies of a game's map, monsters, quests, items, spells, non-playable characters, and more. We also used a wiki crawler to obtain a large amount of data, generate additional code, and guide our cheat scripts in what to look for, clarify, and ignore. After explaining our end-game vision, I'll dive deep into the architecture of the game client, server and protocol. Once that's out of the way, I'll talk about the different types of hacks we used, how they work, and what data they were able to obtain. Once that's out of the way, I'll round out the story by explaining exactly what type of data we gathered and what parts of our toolkit we used to gather it.

[Cooper](https://github.com/chrismaddalena/Cooper)
* Cooper simplifies the process of cloning a target website or email for use in a phishing campaign. Just find a URL or download the raw contents of an email you want to use and feed it to Cooper. Cooper will clone the content and then automatically prepare it for use in your campaign. Scripts, images, and CSS can be modified to use direct links instead of relative links, links are changed to point to your phishing server, and forms are updated to send data to you -- all in a matter of seconds. Cooper is cross-platform and should work with MacOS, Linux, and Windows.

[Python Static Analysis - Spencer J McIntyre - Derbycon7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWIiyOV4Wbk&index=45&list=PLNhlcxQZJSm-PKUZTYe1C94ymf0omysM3)
* Python is a popular language and that is true as well within the Security industry. This talk will outline how Python code can be statically analyzed using publicly available tools such as bandit. It will then take a more technical approach and outline how the abstract syntax tree (AST) can be processed and searched based on behavior clues to identify potential security issues. Many security tools search for vulnerabilities by analyzing the contents of static strings and examining their variable names. This alternative approach instead demonstrates how the AST can be analyzed to identify pieces of sensitive information such as encryption keys and passwords based on matching them with usage patterns. This will be a technical talk focused on using automated techniques to find security vulnerabilities in Python projects. The audience will leave with an understanding of these techniques and how they can be applied to the projects they are either developing themselves or using in their daily routines. This talk will end with a live demonstration of a forked version of the public Bandit scanner where these techniques have been implemented.

* The purpose of this tool is to provide a protocol independent framework that contains a base set of features that can piggyback on top of any collaborative web platform or service. The base docClient and docServer are meant to be extended upon with Buffer classes written for individual web services. These buffer classes can be plugged into the MurDock framework in order to create a unique shell infrastructure that will always contains a base set of features, as well as the ability to tunnel over any web application traffic for which a buffer class has been constructed. The framework can be extended to operate over lower level protocols if desired.

[BAPLIE](http://www.portofantwerp.com/apcs/en/node/449)
* The BAPLIE message is a widely used EDIFACT message in the shipping industry. It is used by and between various parties to advise the exact stowage positions of the cargo on board of an ocean vessel. It is currently chiefly used for container cargo. Besides the container number and the exact position on board, general information regarding the containers is also specified such as weight and hazardous cargo class.

* HTML Applications (HTAs) are full-fledged applications. These applications are trusted and display only the menus, icons, toolbars, and title information that the Web developer creates. In short, HTAs pack all the power of Windows Internet Explorer—its object model, performance, rendering power, protocol support, and channel–download technology—without enforcing the strict security model and user interface of the browser. HTAs can be created using the HTML and Dynamic HTML (DHTML) that you already know. 

[What Is Windows Communication Foundation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/whats-wcf)
* Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) is a framework for building service-oriented applications. Using WCF, you can send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. A service endpoint can be part of a continuously available service hosted by IIS, or it can be a service hosted in an application. An endpoint can be a client of a service that requests data from a service endpoint. The messages can be as simple as a single character or word sent as XML, or as complex as a stream of binary data.

[Fundamental Windows Communication Foundation Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/fundamental-concepts)
*  WCF is a runtime and a set of APIs for creating systems that send messages between services and clients. The same infrastructure and APIs are used to create applications that communicate with other applications on the same computer system or on a system that resides in another company and is accessed over the Internet.
