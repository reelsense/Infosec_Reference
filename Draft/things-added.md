As we’ve seen from the Mirai and Switcher hacks, it’s important to embed the appropriate safeguards so that devices are not open to attack. When selecting device components there are things that should be checked for, and when you’re doing the coding and workflows, there are other things that need to be taken in to account. Although security and privacy are close cousins, they’re also different. This talk will be centered around some best security and privacy practices as well as some common errors that should be avoided.

[Crashing phones with Wi-Fi: Exploiting nitayart's Broadpwn bug (CVE-2017-9417)](http://boosterok.com/blog/broadpwn2/)

[Sigreturn Oriented Programming is a real Threat](https://subs.emis.de/LNI/Proceedings/Proceedings259/2077.pdf)
* Abstract: This paper shows that Sigreturn Oriented Programming (SROP), which consists of using calls to sigreturn to execute arbitrary code, is a pow erful method for the de velopment of exploits. This is demonstrated by developing two different kinds of SROP based exploits, one asterisk exploit which was already portrayed in the paper presenting SROP, and one novel exploit for a recently disclosed bug inthe DNS address resolution of the default GNUC library. Taking advantage of the fact, that these exploits have very few dependencies on the program being exploited, a library is implemented to automate wide parts of SROP exploit creation. This highlights the potential of SROP in respect to reusable and portable exploit code which strongly supports the conclusion of the original paper: SROP is areal threat!

[Rocking the Pocket Book: Hacking Chemical Plant for Competition and Extortion - Marina Krotofil - Jason Larsen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL8L76n0Q9w)
* The appeal of hacking a physical process is dreaming about physical damage attacks lighting up the sky in a shower of goodness. Let’s face it, after such elite hacking action nobody is going to let one present it even at a conference like DEF CON. As a poor substitute, this presentation will get as close as using a simulated plant for Vinyl Acetate production for demonstrating a complete attack, from start to end, directed at persistent economic damage to a production site while avoiding attribution of production loss to a cyber-event. Such an attack scenario could be useful to a manufacturer aiming at putting competitors out of business or as a strong argument in an extortion attack. Exploiting physical process is an exotic and hard to develop skill which have so far kept a high barrier to entry. Therefore real-world control system exploitation has remained in the hands of a few. To help the community mastering new skills we have developed „Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process“ – first open source framework for cyber-physical experimentation based on two realistic models of chemical plants. Come to the session and take your first master class on complex physical hacking.

* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively, warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just intensifies the consequences when they erupt.
Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection is often non-existent.

* When do you ? and other coders, hackers, developers, and tinkerers ? think or worry about the law? If your answer is, ?Not very often,? then this talk is for you. We all need to think about the law. And it?s not just privacy, or computer fraud, or even anti-circumvention law, that we should think about. We need to think about law as a whole and how it can help us do or stop us from doing what we want to do. This talk will start with a broad overview of the ways in which we implicate law when we do what we do, and then will focus on what that means for us and the broader implications that can arise from our various activities. Do you think the law would stop you from doing what you want to do or punish you for doing it? It might, but it also might not. If you think it does, do you think you should be able to do what you want to do? If you do, then we need to hack the law, and to do that we?ll need to talk to the legal coders, those writers of our cultural software. This talk will tackle not only law and working with code, but also why it matters for us to be aware of the law and engaged in improving it.

[rVMI - A New Paradigm For Full System Analysis](https://github.com/fireeye/rvmi)
* rVMI is a debugger on steroids. It leverages Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) and memory forensics to provide full system analysis. This means that an analyst can inspect userspace processes, kernel drivers, and preboot environments in a single tool.  It was specifially designed for interactive dynamic malware analysis. rVMI isolates itself from the malware by placing its interactive debugging environment out of the virtual machine (VM) onto the hypervisor-level. Through the use of VMI the analyst still has full control of the VM, which allows her to pause the VM at any point in time and to use typical debugging features such as breakpoints and watchpoints. In addtion, rVMI provides access to the entire Rekall feature set, which enables an analyst to inspect the kernel and its data structures with ease.

[Boundaries - By Gary Bernhardt from SCNA 2012](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)
* This talk is about using simple values (as opposed to complex objects) not just for holding data, but also as the boundaries between components and subsystems. It moves through many topics: functional programming; mutability's relationship to OO; isolated unit testing with and without test doubles; and concurrency, to name some bar. The "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" screencast mentioned at the end is available as part of season 4 of the DAS catalog. 

[Big picture software testing unit testing, Lean Startup, and everything in between PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vaq_e7qUA-4&feature=youtu.be&t=63s)
* There are many ways you can test your software: unit testing, manual testing, end-to-end testing, and so forth. Take a step back and you'll discover even more form of testing, many of them very different in their goals: A/B testing, say, where you see which of two versions of your website results in more signups or ad clicks. How do these forms of testing differ, how do they relate to each other? How do you choose which kind of testing to pursue, given limited time and resources? How do you deal with strongly held yet opposite views arguing either that a particular kind of testing is essential or that it's a waste time? This talk will provide you with a model, a way to organize all forms of testing and understand what exactly they provide, and why. Once you understand the model you will be able to choose the right form of testing for *your* situation and goals.

["Humans, right?" Soft Skills in Security - Ariel Robinson](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/200-humans-right-soft-skills-in-security-ariel-robinson)
* Let's face it: humans ruin everything. They are almost always the weak link in the information security chain, between their susceptibility to social engineering, rejection of security threats, and sheer laziness. You can make the best security tool in the business, but if a human doesn't use it right, well, you might as well leave your passwords on a sticky note on your-- wait a minute. Yes, humans suck at information security. But we don't make it easy. Infosec is incredibly inaccessible to your average user. Just ask me: I am one. We can't change humans (or get rid of them, no matter how much we might want to), but we can change information security. We can leverage insights from non-technical disciplines such as cognitive science, human-centered design, strategic communications, and psychology. Or we can keep hitting our heads against our desktops. As a professional communicator and bridge builder, help me help you. To make security work, we have to make it easy. For humans.

[Adam Shostack - Pentesting: Lessons from Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfWWryF8M7E&list=PLuUtcRxSUZUpv2An-RNhjuZSJ5fjY7ghe&index=13)
* Everyone knows you ought to threat model, but in practical reality it turns out to be tricky. If past efforts to threat model haven’t panned out, perhaps part of the problem is confusion over what works, and how the various approaches conflict or align. This talk captures lessons from years of work helping people throughout the software industry threat model more effectively. It’s designed to help security pros, especially pen testers, all of whom will leave with both threat modeling lessons from Star Wars and a proven foundation, enabling them to threat model effectively on offense or defense.
