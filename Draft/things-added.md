## Network Scanning and Attacks

* [ntlmRelayToEWS](https://github.com/Arno0x/NtlmRelayToEWS)
	* ntlmRelayToEWS is a tool for performing ntlm relay attacks on Exchange Web Services (EWS). It spawns an SMBListener on port 445 and an HTTPListener on port 80, waiting for incoming connection from the victim. Once the victim connects to one of the listeners, an NTLM negociation occurs and is relayed to the target EWS server.


[ohrwurm](http://mazzoo.de/blog/2006/08/25#ohrwurm)
* ohrwurm is a small and simple RTP fuzzer, I tested it on a small number of SIP phones, none of them did withstand.


[SIP Proxy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sipproxy/)
* With SIP Proxy you will have the opportunity to eavesdrop and manipulate SIP traffic. Furthermore, predefined security test cases can be executed to find weak spots in VoIP devices. Security analysts can add and execute custom test cases.

[Sip Vicious](https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious)
* SIPVicious suite is a set of tools that can be used to audit SIP based VoIP systems. 

[Mr.SIP](https://github.com/meliht/mr.sip)
* Mr.SIP is a tool developed to audit and simulate SIP-based attacks. Originally it was developed to be used in academic work to help developing novel SIP-based DDoS attacks and defense approaches and then as an idea to convert it to a fully functional SIP-based penetration testing tool, it has been redeveloped into the current version.

* This penetration testing tool allows an auditor to intercept SSH connections. A patch applied to the OpenSSH v7.5p1 source code causes it to act as a proxy between the victim and their intended SSH server; all plaintext passwords and sessions are logged to disk.

[warcproxy](https://github.com/internetarchive/warcprox)
* WARC writing MITM HTTP/S proxy

[WSSiP: A WebSocket Manipulation Proxy])(https://github.com/nccgroup/wssip)
