[Hunting For Vulnerabilities In Signal - Markus Vervier - HITB 2017 AMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n9HmllVftA)
* Signal is the most trusted secure messaging and secure voice application, recommended by Edward Snowden and the Grugq. And indeed Signal uses strong cryptography, relies on a solid system architecture, and you’ve never heard of any vulnerability in its code base. That’s what this talk is about: hunting for vulnerabilities in Signal. We will present vulnerabilities found in the Signal Android client, in the underlying Java libsignal library, and in example usage of the C libsignal library. Our demos will show how these can be used to crash Signal remotely, to bypass the MAC authentication for certain attached files, and to trigger memory corruption bugs. Combined with vulnerabilities in the Android system it is even possible to remotely brick certain Android devices. We will demonstrate how to initiate a permanent boot loop via a single Signal message. We will also describe the general architecture of Signal, its attack surface, the tools you can use to analyze it, and the general threat model for secure mobile communication apps.

But sometimes, a film gets it really right! This talk is both an introduction to lockpicking (in case you still need to learn) as well as a walk through some of the best - and some of the worst - scenes of lockpicking that have ever been seen by movie and TV audiences. Learn about how to be a better lockpicker and a better filmmaker... all at the same time!

Your vendor has assured you how it will resist attack and how difficult it would be for someone to copy your key. Maybe they’re right. But… the bulk of attacks that both penetration testers and also criminals attempt against doors have little or nothing to do with the lock itself! This talk will be a hard-hitting exploration (full of photo and video examples) of the ways in which your door — the most fundamental part of your physical security — can possibly be thwarted by someone attempting illicit entry. The scary problems will be immediately followed by simple solutions that are instantly implementable and usually very within-budget. You, too, can have a near-perfect door… if you’re willing to learn and understand the problems that all doors tend to have.

* Many people are familiar with the ways in which mechanical locks can be attacked, compromised, and bypassed. Indeed, the hands-on workshops and the availability of pick tools at the Lockpick Village is an enduring part of the fun at DeepSec and other popular security conferences around the world. Often, attendees will ask questions like, "So, this is really great... but what if someone is using an electronic lock? How hard is it to open the door, then?" Unfortunately, due to time and space constraints, our answer is typically, "Well... that's a very complicated question. Sometimes they're good, and sometimes they're weak." We often promise greater detail another day, another time... but until now that time has not come. Finally now, however, TOOOL will describe some of the most popular electronic locks and show examples of how they can sometimes be attacked.

* In this session, we will reveal and demonstrate perfect exfiltration via indirect covert channels (i.e. the communicating parties don’t directly exchange network packets). This is a family of techniques to exfiltrate data (low throughput) from an enterprise in a manner indistinguishable from genuine traffic. Using HTTP and exploiting a byproduct of how some websites choose to cache their pages, we will demonstrate how data can be leaked without raising any suspicion. These techniques are designed to overcome even perfect knowledge and analysis of the enterprise network traffic.

[A Survey of Covert Channels and Countermeasures in Computer Network Protocols](http://caia.swin.edu.au/cv/szander/publications/szander-ieee-comst07.pdf)
* Covert channels are used for the secret transfer of information. Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorised parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication. Initially, covert channels were identified as a security threat on monolithic systems i.e. mainframes. More recently focus has shifted towards covert channels in computer network protocols. The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet seems ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This article is a survey of the existing techniques for creating covert channels in widely deployed network and application protocols. We also give an overview of common methods for their detection, elimination, and capacity limitation, required to improve security in future computer networks.

* As a part of an ongoing investigation on Adobe Flash SOP bypass techniques, we identified a vulnerability affecting old releases of the Adobe Flex SDK compiler. Further investigation traced the issue back to a well known vulnerability (CVE20112461), already patched by Adobe. Old vulnerability, let's move on? Not this time. CVE20112461 is a very interesting bug. As long as the SWF file was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK, attackers can still use this vulnerability against the latest web browsers and Flash plugin. Even with the most recent updates, vulnerable Flex applications hosted on your domain can be exploited. In this presentation, we will disclose the details of this vulnerability (Adobe has never released all technicalities) and we will discuss how we conducted a large scale analysis on popular websites, resulting in the identification of numerous Alexa Top 50 sites vulnerable to this bug. Finally, we will also release a custom tool and a Burp plugin capable of detecting vulnerable SWF applications.
