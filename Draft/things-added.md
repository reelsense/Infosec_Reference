So we decided to have a look at it. In our presentation, we’ll first cover some theory behind the IT-part of car architecture. We’ll discuss attack vectors and their likelihood of success, and then discuss the various vulnerabilities we found. Finally, we will combine these vulnerabilities into a remote attack. Depending on the disclosure process with the vendor, which is pending, we might be able to demonstrate the attack.

* The market share of home security systems has substantially increased as vendors incorporate more desirable features: intrusion detection, automation, wireless, and LCD touch panel controls. Wireless connectivity allows vendors to manufacture cheaper, more featureful products that require little to no home modification to install.  Consumer win, since adding devices is easier. The result: an ostensibly more secure, convenient, and connected home for a larger number of citizens. Sadly, this hypothesis is flawed; the idea of covering a home with more security sensors does not translate into a more secure home.  Additionally, the number of homes using these vulnerable systems is large, and the growth rate is increasing producing a even larger problem. In this paper, we will demonstrate a generalized approach for compromising three systems: ADT, the largest home security dealer in North America; Honeywell, one of the largest manufacturers of security devices; and Vivint, a top 5 security dealer.  We will suppress alarms, create false alarms, and collect artifacts that facilitate tracking the movements of individuals in their homes

For example as Vincent Yiu pointed out on Twitter if you've got easy access to a system token, say using Metasploit's getsystem command you can impersonate system and then open the TI token, it's just IMO less easy :-). If you get a system token with SeTcbPrivilege you can also call LogonUserExExW or LsaLogonUser where you can specify an set of additional groups to apply to a service token. Finally if you get a system token with SeCreateTokenPrivilege (say from LSASS.exe if it's not running PPL) you can craft an arbitrary token using the NtCreateToken system call.
