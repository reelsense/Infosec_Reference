[Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)
* Linux Exploit Suggester; based on operating system release number.  This program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux Operating Systems release version, and return a suggestive list of possible exploits. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this script.  Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

[Basic Linux Privilege Escalation - g0tmi1k](http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/)
* Not so much a script as a resource, g0tmi1k’s blog post here has led to so many privilege escalations on Linux system’s it’s not funny. Would definitely recommend trying out everything on this post for enumerating systems.
[LinEnum](http://www.rebootuser.com/?p=1758)
* This tool is great at running through a heap of things you should check on a Linux system in the post exploit process. This include file permissions, cron jobs if visible, weak credentials etc. The first thing I run on a newly compromised system.
[LinuxPrivChecker](http://www.securitysift.com/download/linuxprivchecker.py)
* This is a great tool for once again checking a lot of standard things like file permissions etc. The real gem of this script is the recommended privilege escalation exploits given at the conclusion of the script. This is a great starting point for escalation.
[Unix Privilege Escalation Checker](https://code.google.com/p/unix-privesc-check/)
* Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases). It is written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because it can read more files).

* This paper analyzes three vulnerabilities that were found in win32k.sys that allow kernel-mode code execution. The win32k.sys driver is a major component of the GUI subsystem in the Windows operating system. These vulnerabilities have been reported by the author and patched in MS08-025. The first vulnerability is a kernel pool overflow with an old communication mechanism called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. The second vulnerability involves improper use of the ProbeForWrite function within string management functions. The third vulnerability concerns how win32k handles system menu functions. Their discovery and exploitation are covered.

* Windows APIs are often a blackbox with poor documentation, taking input and spewing output with little visibility on what actually happens in the background. By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques. In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing 0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

The problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket- Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately- we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

Kext programming and kernel patching can be troublesome! Leverage already running daemon processes to guarantee your access.  As the presentation will show, if given userland administrative access (read: root), how easy it is to persist between reboots without plists, non-native binaries, scripting, and kexts or kernel patching using the Backdoor Factory.

* Description: In this talk we’ll do an architectural decomposition of application sandboxing technology from a security perspective. We look at various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

* Kerberos- besides having three heads and guarding the gates of hell- protects services on Microsoft Windows Domains. Its use is increasing due to the growing number of attacks targeting NTLM authentication. Attacking Kerberos to access Windows resources represents the next generation of attacks on Windows authentication.In this talk Tim will discuss his research on new attacks against Kerberos- including a way to attack the credentials of a remote service without sending traffic to the service as well as rewriting tickets to access systems.He will also examine potential countermeasures against Kerberos attacks with suggestions for mitigating the most common weaknesses in Windows Kerberos deployments.
