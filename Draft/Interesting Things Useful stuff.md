[Richard Thieme - The Impact of Dark Knowledge and Secrets on Security and Intelligence Professionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MzcPBAj88A&list=PLuUtcRxSUZUpv2An-RNhjuZSJ5fjY7ghe)
* Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively, warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just intensifies the consequences when they erupt.
Philip K. Dick said, reality is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection is often non-existent.

[Ermahgerd: Lawrs - Robert Heverly - Anycon17](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/anycon2017/305-ermahgerd-lawrs-prof-robert-heverly)
* When do you ? and other coders, hackers, developers, and tinkerers ? think or worry about the law? If your answer is, ?Not very often,? then this talk is for you. We all need to think about the law. And it?s not just privacy, or computer fraud, or even anti-circumvention law, that we should think about. We need to think about law as a whole and how it can help us do or stop us from doing what we want to do. This talk will start with a broad overview of the ways in which we implicate law when we do what we do, and then will focus on what that means for us and the broader implications that can arise from our various activities. Do you think the law would stop you from doing what you want to do or punish you for doing it? It might, but it also might not. If you think it does, do you think you should be able to do what you want to do? If you do, then we need to hack the law, and to do that we?ll need to talk to the legal coders, those writers of our cultural software. This talk will tackle not only law and working with code, but also why it matters for us to be aware of the law and engaged in improving it.

### Interesting Talks/Videos

[Kim Jong-il and Me: How to Build a Cyber Army to Defeat the U.S. - Charlie MIller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4up0yTGlpaU)

[Just What The Doctor Ordered? - Scott Erven and Shawn Merdinger - DEF CON 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTEMSBXtkAc)
* This discussion will also highlight the fallout from security standards not being a requirement for medical device manufacturers, and our experience in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities. We will provide our insight into what needs to be done for healthcare organizations to respond to the new threat of cyber-attack against medical devices. We are working towards a future where cyber security issues in medical devices are a thing of the past. We will discuss the recent success and traction we have gained with healthcare organizations, federal agencies and device manufacturers in addressing these security issues. The train is now moving, so please join us to find out how you can get involved and make a difference by ensuring patient safety.

[Evaluating the APT Armor - Matthias Luft, Felix Wilhelm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vh2s9Pui0E)

[Psychology of Security - Stefan Schumacher - Trooper14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZKAi4RAIvA)
* In this talk I will introduce the Institute’s research programme about the Psychology of Security. We are going to research the psychological basics of IT security, including: How do people experience IT security? How are they motivated? How do they learn? Why do people tend to make the same mistakes again and again (Buffer Overflow, anyone?)? What can we do to prevent security incidents? Which curricula should be taught about IT security?

[You're Leaking Trade Secrets - Defcon22 Michael Schrenk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd5TL6_zgY)
* Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.

[You and Your Research - Haroon Meer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoVx_-bM8Tg)
* What does it take to do quality research? What stops you from being a one-hit wonder? Is there an age limit to productive hackery? What are the key ingredients needed and how can you up your chances of doing great work? In a talk unabashedly stolen from far greater minds we hope to answer these questions and discuss their repercussions.

[A talk about (info-sec) talks - Haroon Meer ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlVjdUkrSFY)
* Last year there was an Information Security conference taking place for almost every day of the year. This translates to about 15 information security talks per day, every day. The question is, is this a bad thing? Even niche areas of the info-sec landscape have their own dedicated conference these days. Is this a good thing?

[Software Supply Chains and the Illusion of Control - Derek Weeks](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/107-software-supply-chains-and-the-illusion-of-control-derek-weeks)
* In this presentation I am sharing the results of a three-year, industry-wide study on open source development and security practices across 3,000 organizations and 25,000. I will detail how these organizations are employing a vast community of open source component suppliers, warehouses, and development tools that take the form of software supply chains. Modern software development practices are now consuming BILLIONS of open source and third-party components. The tooling with package managers and build tools such as Maven, Gradle, npm, NuGet, RubyGems and others has promoted the usage of components to a convenient standard practice. As a result, 90% of a typical application is now composed of open source components. The good news: use of the components is improving developer productivity and accelerating time to market. However, using these components brings ownership and responsibility with it and this fact is largely overlooked. The unspoken truth: not all parts are created equal. For example, 1 in 16 components in use include known security vulnerabilities. Ugh. This session aims to enlighten development professionals by sharing results from the State of the Software Supply Chain reports from 2015 through 2017. The reports blend of public and proprietary data with expert research and analysis. Attendees in this session will learn: - What our analysis of 25,000 applications reveals about the quality and security of software built with open source components - How organizations like Mayo Clinic, Exxon, Capital One, the U.S. FDA and Intuit are utilizing the principles of software supply chain automation to improve application security - Why avoiding open source components over 3 years old might be a really good idea - How to balance the need for speed with quality and security -- early in the development lifecycle We will also discuss how you can best approach the effort for development teams to identify, track and replace components with known vulnerabilities, while getting more products and new features to market quickly. Attend this session and gain insight as to how your organization’s application development practices compare to others. I'll share the industry benchmarks to take back and discuss with your development, security, and open source governance teams.

[Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer bug to gain kernel privileges](http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html)
* "Rowhammer” is a problem with some recent DRAM devices in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. We tested a selection of laptops and found that a subset of them exhibited the problem. We built two working privilege escalation exploits that use this effect. One exploit uses rowhammer-induced bit flips to gain kernel privileges on x86-64 Linux when run as an unprivileged userland process. When run on a machine vulnerable to the rowhammer problem, the process was able to induce bit flips in page table entries (PTEs). It was able to use this to gain write access to its own page table, and hence gain read-write access to all of physical memory.

### Interesting Papers


[Wars Within](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=26&t=sumry)
* In this paper I will uncover the information exchange of what may be classified as one of the highest money making schemes coordinated by 'organized crime'. I will elaborate on information gathered from a third party individual directly involved in all aspects of the scheme at play. I will provide a detailed explanation of this market's origin, followed by a brief description of some of the actions strategically performed by these individuals in order to ensure their success. Finally, I will elaborate on real world examples of how a single person can be labeled a spammer, malware author, cracker, and an entrepreneur gone thief. For the purposes of avoiding any legal matters, and unwanted media, I will refrain from mentioning the names of any individuals and corporations who are involved in the schemes described in this paper.

[Towards Optimization-Safe Systems: Analyzing the Impact of Undefined Behavior](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~xi/papers/stack-sosp13.pdf)
* This paper studies an emerging class of software bugs called optimization-unstable code: code that is unexpectedly discarded by compiler optimizations due to undefined behavior in the program. Unstable code is present in many systems, including the Linux kernel and the Postgres database. The consequences of unstable code range from incorrect functionality to missing security checks. To reason about unstable code, this paper proposes a novel model, which views unstable code in terms of optimizations that leverage undefined behavior. Using this model, we introduce a new static checker called Stack that precisely identifies unstable code. Applying Stack to widely used systems has uncovered 160 new bugs that have been confirmed and fixed by developers

[The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/geometry.pdf)
* We present new techniques that allow a return-into-libc attack to be mounted on x86 executables that calls no functions at all. Our attack combines a large number of short instruction sequences to build gadgets that allow arbitrary computation. We show how to discover such instruction sequences by means of static analysis. We make use, in an essential way, of the properties of the x86 instruction set.

[A Practical Methodology for Measuring the Side-Channel Signal Available to the Attacker for Instruction-Level Event](http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~az30/Downloads/Micro14.pdf)
* Abstract: This paper presents a new metric, which we call Signal Available to Attacker (SAVAT), that measures the side channel signal created by a specific single-instruction difference in program execution, i.e. the amount of signal made available to a potential attacker who wishes to decide whether the program has executed instruction/event A or instruction/event B. We also devise a practical methodology for measuring SAVAT in real systems using only user-level access permissions and common measurement equipment. Finally, we perform a case study where we measure electromagnetic (EM) emanations SAVAT among 11 different instructions for three different laptop systems. Our findings from these experiments confirm key intuitive expectations, e.g. that SAVAT between on-chip instructions and off-chip memory accesses tends to be higher than between two on-chip instructions. However, we find that particular instructions, such as integer divide, have much higher SAVAT than other instructions in the same general category (integer arithmetic), and that last-level-cache hits and misses have similar (high) SAVAT. Overall, we confirm that our new metric and methodology can help discover the most vulnerable aspects of a processor architecture or a program, and thus inform decision-making about how to best manage the overall side channel vulnerability of a processor, a program, or a system.

[A Tale of Two Kernels: Towards Ending Kernel Hardening Wars with Split Kernel](http://split.kernel.build/papers/ccs14.pdf)
* Abstract: Software security practitioners are often torn between choosing per- formance or security. In particular, OS kernels are sensitive to the smallest performance regressions. This makes it difficult to develop innovative kernel hardening mechanisms: they may inevitably incur some run-time performance overhead. Here, we propose building each kernel function with and without hardening, within a single split kernel . In particular, this allows trusted processes to be run under unmodified kernel code, while system calls of untrusted pro- cesses are directed to the hardened kernel code. We show such trusted processes run with no overhead when compared to an un- modified kernel. This allows deferring the decision of making use of hardening to the run-time. This means kernel distributors, system administrators and users can selectively enable hardening accord- ing to their needs: we give examples of such cases. Although this approach cannot be directly applied to arbitrary kernel hardening mechanisms, we show cases where it can. Finally, our implementa- tion in the Linux kernel requires few changes to the kernel sources and no application source changes. Thus, it is both maintainable and easy to use

[Annoyances Caused by Unsafe Assumptions](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=5&t=sumry)
* This installation of What Were They Thinking illustrates some of the annoyances that can be caused when developing software that has to inter-operate with third-party applications. Two such cases will be dissected and discussed in detail for the purpose of showing how third-party applications can fail when used in conjunction with software that performs certain tasks. The analysis of the two cases is meant to show how complex failure conditions can be analyzed and used to determine inter-operability problems.

[Ceremony Design and Analysis](http://eprint.iacr.org/2007/399.pdf)
* Abstract: The concept of Ceremony is introduced as an extension of the concept of network protocol, with human nodes alongside computer nodes and with communication links that include UI, human-to-human communication and transfers of physical objects that carry data. What is out-of-band to a protocol is in-band to a ceremony, and therefore subject to design and analysis using variants of the same mature techniques used for the design and analysis of protocols. Ceremonies include all protocols, as well as all applications with a user interface, all workflow and all provisioning scenarios. A secure ceremony is secure against both normal attacks and social engineering. However, some secure protocols imply ceremonies that cannot be made secure. 

[It’s all about the timing. . . Blackhat talk](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Meer_and_Slaviero/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-meer_and_slaviero-WP.pdf)
* Description: This paper is broken up into several distinct parts, all related loosely to timing and its role in information se- curity today. While timing has long been recognized as an important component in the crypt-analysts arse- nal, it has not featured very prominently in the domain of Application Security Testing. This paper aims at highlighting some of the areas in which timing can be used with great effect, where traditional avenues fail. In this paper, a brief overview of previous timing attacks is provided, the use of timing as a covert channel is examined and the effectiveness of careful timing during traditional web application and SQL injection attacks is demonstrated. The use of Cross Site Timing in bypass- ing the Same Origin policy is explored as we believe the technique has interesting possibilities for turning innocent browsers into bot-nets aimed at, for instance, brute-force attacks against third party web-sites

[Seven Months’ Worth of Mistakes: A Longitudinal Study of Typosquatting Abuse](https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/471369/3/typos-final.pdf)
* Abstract: Typosquatting is the act of purposefully registering a domain name that is a mistype of a popular domain name. It is a concept that has been known and studied for over 15 years, yet still thoroughly practiced up until this day. While previous typosquatting studies have always taken a snapshot of the typosquatting landscape or base their longitudinal results only on domain registration data, we present the first content- based , longitudinal study of typosquatting. We collected data about the typosquatting domains of the 500 most popular sites of the Internet every day, for a period of seven months, and we use this data to establish whether previously discovered typosquatting trends still hold today, and to provide new results and insights in the typosquatting landscape. In particular we reveal that, even though 95% of the popular domains we investigated are actively targeted by typosquatters, only few trademark owners protect themselves against this practice by proactively registering their own typosquatting domains. We take advantage of the longitudinal aspect of our study to show, among other results, that typosquatting domains change hands from typosquatters to legitimate owners and vice versa, and that typosquatters vary their monetization strategy by hosting different types of pages over time. Our study also reveals that a large fraction of typosquatting domains can be traced back to a small group of typosquatting page hosters and that certain top-level domains are much more prone to typosquatting than others

[RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/)
* Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.

[Get Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/)
* We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our attacks use novel side channels and are based on the observation that the "ground" electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a computation-dependent way. An attacker can measure this signal by touching exposed metal on the computer's chassis with a plain wire, or even with a bare hand. The signal can also be measured at the remote end of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables. Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have extracted 4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via each of these channels, as well as via power analysis and electromagnetic probing. Despite the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops and numerous noise sources, the full attacks require a few seconds of measurements using Medium Frequency signals (around 2 MHz), or one hour using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz).

[QR Inception: Barcode-in-Barcode Attacks](https://www.sba-research.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/qrinception.pdf)
* 2D barcodes offer many benefits compared to 1D barcodes, such as high information density and robustness. Before their introduction to the mobile phone ecosystem, they have been widely used in specific applications, such as logistics or ticketing. However, there are multiple competing standards with different benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, reader applications as well as dedicated devices have to support multiple standards. In this paper, we present novel attacks based on deliberately caused ambiguities when especially crafted barcodes conform to multiple standards. Implementation details decide which standard the decoder locks on. This way, two users scanning the same barcode with different phones or apps will receive different content. This potentially opens way for multiple problems related to security. We describe how embedding one barcode symbology into another can be used to perform phishing attacks as well as targeted exploits. In addition, we evaluate the extent to which popular 2D barcode reader applications on smartphones are susceptible to these barcode-in-barcode attacks. We furthermore discuss mitigation techniques against this type of attack.
