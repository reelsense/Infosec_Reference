Who is the target audience for this?

The intended target audience for the following information is not anyone trying to escape an oppressive regime or someone trying to avoid compromise from a nation-state entity. 

It is intended as a guide for the lowest common denominator. I’m not going to write out a super long/secure guide only to have ten people use it. If you’re looking for a more effective hardening guide for windows, please check out these links:

With that said, most issues can be avoided through keeping your system up to date with Windows Update Services, not installing software from unknown locations, and not installing Flash or Java unless you must. 

Securing Windows Desktop

Make sure your system has the latest updates and patches available through Windows Update Service.

Create a baseline configuration.
I advise that you create a security baseline once you have applied the latest patches and updates. This allows you to have a point of reference to work from. From this, you can start planning on what specific techniques you will use to harden your system.
