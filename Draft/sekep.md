[I Will Kill You - Chris Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=9FdHq3WfJgs&t=77&app=desktop)
Have you ever wanted to kill someone? Do you want to get rid of your partner, your boss or your arch nemesis? Perhaps you want to enjoy your life insurance payout whilst you’re still alive. Do you have rich elderly parents that just won’t die quick enough? Or do you want a “Do Over” new identity.  Then, this presentation is for you! I’ll provide you with the insight and techniques on how to “kill” someone and obtain a real death certificate and shutdown their lives. It focuses on the lack of security controls that allow any of us to virtually kill off anyone or any number of people. Forget the Dexter way of killing someone, I’ll show you how to avoid the messy clean up and focusing in on the digital aspects. You could be dead right now and not even know it.

 * In this talk, we aim to briefly cover the background of sock puppets (and related attacks) before moving on to real world demonstrations & “attacks“. Rigging polls, abusing Twitter, causing Reddit riots & targeting popular news organisations are some of the (many) attacks covered. In all these cases we discuss what we tried, what worked, what didn’t and what the implications are of the attacks. Where possible we will cover defences and solutions.

[You Can Type, but You Can’t Hide: A Stealthy GPU-based Keylogger](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/gpukeylogger.eurosec13.pdf) 
* Keyloggers are a prominent class of malware that harvests sensitive data by recording any typed in information. Key- logger implementations strive to hide their presence using rootkit-like techniques to evade detection by antivirus and other system protections. In this paper, we present a new approach for implementing a stealthy keylogger: we explore the possibility of leveraging the graphics card as an alterna- tive environment for hosting the operation of a keylogger. The key idea behind our approach is to monitor the system’s keyboard buffer directly from the GPU via DMA, without any hooks or modifications in the kernel’s code and data structures besides the page table. The evaluation of our pro- totype implementation shows that a GPU-based keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them in the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data in-place, with negligible runtime overhead.

Drones:
	
* Mount a rasppi running kali linux with automated wifi attacks on a medium-duty drone. Fly it to the 40th floor of your favorite bank's hq. Hover for 3-5 minutes while the automated attack does its thing. Depart & hide.
* Conduct a drone "suicide mission" by mounting an EMP device as the payload. Land on top of a "mobile command" van and fire away. Pulse should destroy the drone's electronics, along with anything in the van, thus blinding C&C.
* Conduct another suicide mission by flying a payload into a cell tower. Fuck it.., fly a heavy-duty payload with a rasppi, hackrf, and some solid coding, and plant it in front of a cell tower. Commence radio hijinks.
* Use smaller drones with red/green construction paper mounted on toothpicks. Fly & hover in front of stoplights to confuse traffic.
* Fly lighted minidrones over traffic at night. Hubsan X4 over a freeway anyone?
* Use a drone as a distraction. Fly it over a prison while the real action happens under the south wall.
* If not a distraction, then as a probe. Send a sacrifice from afar into a secure perimeter to observe the reaction.
* Create electrical shorts by flying with an attached wire hangar (or other light metal thread) into power lines.
* Use a sunroof-deployed minidrone to follow someone in traffic from 2-3 blocks back.
* Harass Diane Fenstein.
* Use a heavy-duty, autonomous drone to deposit small amounts of radioactive material on rooftops of tall buildings in a major city.
* Fly it slowly just above your head while walking down a busy city street. Staring up at a device will be unusual and awkward. Or maybe you get laid,
* Attach a fucking handgun and perform remote strong-arm robberies

* Flying drones over competitors (e.g. Data Centers)
* Flying drones into crowds with grenades, anthrax, etc - no human martyr required
* Flying drones over prisons to drop drugs, shivs, phones and checking guard rotation timings, vehicle placements and info
* Drones used for personal tracking, checking home windows for premptive robberies (see if anyone's on holiday)
* Drones stealing small items (e.g. with claw attached, jewelry)
* Assassinations of course, small guns or needles
* Drones used by media to spy on celebrities in locations the paparazzi cannot get to (beaches, private pools, private parties)
