### <a name="evasion">IDS/IPS Evasion</a>


[Intrusion detection evasion:  How Attackers get past the burglar alarm](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/intrusion-detection-evasion-attackers-burglar-alarm-1284)
* The purpose of this paper is to show methods that attackers can use to fool IDS systems into thinking their attack is legitimate traffic. With techniques like obfuscation, fragmentation, Denial of Service, and application hijacking the attacker can pass traffic under the nose of an IDS to prevent their detection. These are techniques that the next generation of IDS needs to be able to account for and prevent. Since it would be almost impossible to create a product that was not vulnerable to one of these deceptions.


[Beating the IPS](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/intrusion/beating-ips-34137) 
* This paper introduces various Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) evasion techniques and shows how they can be used to successfully evade detection by widely used products from major security vendors. By manipulating the header, payload, and traffic flow of a well-known attack, it is possible to trick the IPS inspection engines into passing the traffic - allowing the attacker shell access to the target system protected by the IPS.

### MitM Tools
[Ettercap](https://ettercap.github.io/ettercap/)
Ettercap is a comprehensive suite for man in the middle attacks. It features sniffing of live connections, content filtering on the fly and many other interesting tricks. It supports active and passive dissection of many protocols and includes many features for network and host analysis.

[Dsniff](http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsniff/)
dsniff is a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing. dsniff, filesnarf, mailsnarf, msgsnarf, urlsnarf, and webspy passively monitor a network for interesting data (passwords, e-mail, files, etc.). arpspoof, dnsspoof, and macof facilitate the interception of network traffic normally unavailable to an attacker (e.g, due to layer-2 switching). sshmitm and webmitm implement active monkey-in-the-middle attacks against redirected SSH and HTTPS sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI. 

[SSLsplit - transparent and scalable SSL/TLS interception](https://www.roe.ch/SSLsplit)
* SSLsplit is a tool for man-in-the-middle attacks against SSL/TLS encrypted network connections. Connections are transparently intercepted through a network address translation engine and redirected to SSLsplit. SSLsplit terminates SSL/TLS and initiates a new SSL/TLS connection to the original destination address, while logging all data transmitted. SSLsplit is intended to be useful for network forensics and penetration testing.  SSLsplit supports plain TCP, plain SSL, HTTP and HTTPS connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.

[Seth](https://github.com/SySS-Research/Seth)
* Seth is a tool written in Python and Bash to MitM RDP connections. It attempts to downgrade the connection and extract clear text credentials.

* This is a MiTM weaponized exploit script to inject 'fake' updates into non-SSL WSUS traffic. It is based on the WSUSpect Proxy application that was introduced to public on the Black Hat USA 2015 presentation, 'WSUSpect - Compromising the Windows Enterprise via Windows Update'

[net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds)
* Thoroughly sniff passwords and hashes from an interface or pcap file. Concatenates fragmented packets and does not rely on ports for service identification
* It sniffs: URLs visited; POST loads sent; HTTP form logins/passwords; HTTP basic auth logins/passwords; HTTP searches; FTP logins/passwords; IRC logins/passwords; POP logins/passwords; IMAP logins/passwords; Telnet logins/passwords; SMTP logins/passwords; SNMP community string; NTLMv1/v2 all supported protocols like HTTP, SMB, LDAP, etc; Kerberos.







------------
#### Netbios

[NbtScan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)
* This is a command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of open shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool nbtstat, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one. I wrote this tool because the existing tools either didn't do what I wanted or ran only on the Windows platforms: mine runs on just about everything.










------------
#### Network Host Discovery/Service Discovery:

[Nmap](http://nmap.org/)
* Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

[Firewalk](http://packetfactory.openwall.net/projects/firewalk/)
* Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a  given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk  works  by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway.  If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED  message.  If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on  the floor and we will see no response. To get  the  correct  IP  TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need  to  ramp  up  hop-counts.   We  do  this  in the same manner that traceroute works.  Once we have the gateway hopcount (at  that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.

* C3CM: the acronym for command- control- and communi - cations countermeasures. Ripe for use in the information security realm, C3CM takes us past C2 analysis and to the next level. Initially, C3CM was most often intended to wreck the command and control of enemy air defense networks, a very specific military mission. We-ll apply that mindset in the context of combating bots and other evil. Our version of C3CM therefore is to identify, interrupt, and counter the command, control, and communications capabilities of our digital assailants. The three phases of C3CM will utilize: Nfsight with Nfdump, Nfsen, and fprobe to conduct our identification phase, Bro with Logstash and Kibana for the interruption phase, and ADHD for the counter phase. Converge these on one useful platform and you too might have a chance deter those who would do you harm. We-ll discuss each of these three phases (identify, interrupt, and counter) with tooling and tactics, complete with demonstrations and methodology attendees can put to use in their environments.

[Passive IPS Reconnaissance and Enumeration - false positive (ab)use - Arron Finnon](https://vimeo.com/108775823)
* Network Intrusion Prevention Systems or NIPS have been plagued by "False Positive" issues almost since their first deployment. A "False Positive" could simply be described as incorrectly or mistakenly detecting a threat that is not real. A large amount of research has gone into using "False Positive" as an attack vector either to attack the very validity of an IPS system or to conduct forms of Denial of Service attacks. However the very reaction to a "False Positive" in the first place may very well reveal more detailed information about defences than you might well think.

* Cloud service providers and data centers offer their customers the ability to deploy virtual machines within multi-tenant environments. These virtual machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. In this talk I will demonstrate the effects of VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform, including results of attacks originating from the physically connected network as well as within the virtual networks themselves. Each attack category that is discussed will be accompanied by a detailed proof of concept demonstration of the attack.

[Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)
* "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it-s something like the proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL (Event Trace Log) file. What-s new is that that Network Monitor can read any ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers can be decoded."
