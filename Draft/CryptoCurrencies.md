[Deanonymisation of Clients in Bitcoin P2P Network](http://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/18679/1/Ccsfp614s-biryukovATS.pdf)
* We present an effcient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or rewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-o by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the Bitcoin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verifed. The estimated success rate is between 11% and 60% depending on how stealthy an attacker wants to be. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks.
