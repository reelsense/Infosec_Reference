[Developing a Open Source Threat Intelligence Program—Edward McCabe](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/circlecitycon2014/105-developing-a-open-source-threat-intelligence-program-edward-mccabe)
* What if you could get out in front of common threats such as botnets, scanners and malware? Good news, you can. Learn about one geeks struggle with life on the Internet of (bad) things when it comes to being online, identifying “odd” things, and developing an Open Source Threat Intelligence Program from Open Source Tools and Public Sources.

[Corporate Espionage: Gathering Actionable Intelligence Via Covert Operations - Brent White - Defcon22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2N6FclMMTg)

[You're Leaking Trade Secrets - Defcon22 Michael Schrenk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd5TL6_zgY)
* Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets. While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent use of The Internet.
