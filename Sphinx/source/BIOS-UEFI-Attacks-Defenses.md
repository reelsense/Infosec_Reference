* [Attacking UEFI Boot Script](https://frab.cccv.de/system/attachments/2566/original/venamis_whitepaper.pdf)

  * Abstract—UEFI Boot Script is a data structure interpreted by UEFI firmware
    during S3 resume. We show that on many systems, an attacker with ring0
    privileges can alter this data structure. As a result, by forcing S3
    suspend/resume cycle, an attacker can run arbitrary code on a platform that
    is not yet fully locked. The consequences include ability to overwrite the
    flash storage and take control over SMM.

### Firmware Analysis

* [An Introduction to Firmware Analysis[30c3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvfP7StmFxY)

  * This talk gives an introduction to firmware analysis: It starts with how to
    retrieve the binary, e.g. get a plain file from manufacturer, extract it
    from an executable or memory device, or even sniff it out of an update
    process or internal CPU memory, which can be really tricky. After that it
    introduces the necessary tools, gives tips on how to detect the processor
    architecture, and explains some more advanced analysis techniques, including
    how to figure out the offsets where the firmware is loaded to, and how to
    start the investigation.

### Talks & Presentations

* [BIOS Chronomancy: Fixing the Core Root of Trust for Measurement - BlackHat 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbYZ4UCN9GY)
* [Hacking Measured Boot and UEFI - Defcon20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiqcog1sk2E)

  * There's been a lot buzz about UEFI Secure Booting, and the ability of
    hardware and software manufacturers to lock out third-party loaders (and
    rootkits). Even the NSA has been advocating the adoption of measured boot
    and hardware-based integrity checks. But what does this trend mean to the
    open source and hacker communities? In this talk I'll demonstrate measured
    boot in action. I'll also be releasing my new Measured Boot Tool which
    allows you to view Trusted Platform Module (TPM) boot data and identify
    risks such as unsigned early-boot drivers. And, I'll demonstrate how
    measured boot is used for remote device authentication. Finally, I'll
    discuss weaknesses in the system (hint: bootstrapping trust is still hard),
    what this technology means to the consumerization trend in IT, and what
    software and services gaps exist in this space for aspiring entrepreneurs.

  * On modern Intel based computers there exists two powerful and protected code
    regions: the UEFI firmware and System Management Mode (SMM). UEFI is the
    replacement for conventional BIOS and has the responsibility of initializing
    the platform. SMM is a powerful mode of execution on Intel CPUs that is even
    more privileged than a hypervisor. Because of their powerful positions, SMM
    and UEFI are protected by a variety of hardware mechanisms. In this talk,
    Rafal Wojtczuk and Corey Kallenberg team up to disclose several prevalent
    vulnerabilities that result in SMM runtime breakin as well as arbitrary
    reflash of the UEFI firmware.

* [Detecting BadBIOS, Evil Maids, Bootkits and Other Firmware Malware - Paul English and Lee Fisher](https://archive.org/details/seagl-2017)

  * For attackers, platform firmware is the new Software. Most systems include
    hundreds of firmwares - UEFI or BIOS, PCIe expansion ROMs, USB controller
    drivers, storage controller host and disk/SSD drivers. Firmware-level hosted
    malware, bare-metal or virtualized, is nearly invisible to normal security
    detection tools, has full control of your system, and can often continue
    running even when the system is "powered off". Security Firms (eg, "Hacking
    Team" sell UEFI 0days to the highest bidder), and government agencies
    include firmware-level malware (eg, Wikileak'ed Vault7 CIA EFI malware).
    Defenders need to catch-up, and learn to defend their systems against
    firmware-level malware. In this presentation, we'll cover the NIST SP
    (147,147b,155,193) secure firmware guidance, for citizens, rather than
    vendors/enterprises. We'll discuss the problem of firmware-level malware,
    and cover some open source tools (FlashROM, CHIPSEC, etc.) to help detect
    malware on your system. We'll be discussing a new open source tool we've
    just released to help make it easier for you to do this check. You'll also
    get a nice paper tri-fold copy of our CHIPSEC Quick Reference for Sysadmins
    [note: we're all sysadmins for our own personal systems(!)], and some scary
    looking BadBIOS stickers for your laptop.

* [SMM Rootkits:A New Breed of OS Independent Malware](http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~czou/research/SMM-Rootkits-Securecom08.pdf)

  * The emergence of hardware virtualization technology has led to the
    development of OS independent malware such as the Virtual Machine based
    rootkits (VMBRs). In this paper, we draw attention to a different but
    related threat that exists on many commodity systems in operation today: The
    System Management Mode based rootkit (SMBR). System Management Mode (SMM) is
    a relatively obscure mode on Intel processors used for low-level hardware
    control. It has its own private memory space and execution environment which
    is generally invisible to code running outside (e.g., the Operating System).
    Furthermore, SMM code is completely non-preemptible, lacks any concept of
    privilege level, and is immune to memory protection mechanisms. These
    features make it a potentially attractive home for stealthy rootkits. In
    this paper, we present our development of a proof of concept SMM rootkit. In
    it, we explore the potential of System Management Mode for malicious use by
    implementing a chipset level keylogger and a network backdoor capable of
    directly interacting with the network card to send logged keystrokes to a
    remote machine via UDP. The rootkit hides its memory footprint and requires
    no changes to the existing Operating System. It is compared and contrasted
    with VMBRs. Finally, techniques to defend against these threats are
    explored. By taking an offensive perspective we hope to help security
    researchers better understand the depth and scope of the problems posed by
    an emerging class of OS independent malware.
