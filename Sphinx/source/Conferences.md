# Information Security Conference Videos & Stuff

### General

* [You and Your Research - Haroon Meer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoVx_-bM8Tg)

  * What does it take to do quality research? What stops you from being a
    one-hit wonder? Is there an age limit to productive hackery? What are the
    key ingredients needed and how can you up your chances of doing great work?
    In a talk unabashedly stolen from far greater minds we hope to answer these
    questions and discuss their repercussions.

  * Last year there was an Information Security conference taking place for
    almost every day of the year. This translates to about 15 information
    security talks per day, every day. The question is, is this a bad thing?
    Even niche areas of the info-sec landscape have their own dedicated
    conference these days. Is this a good thing?
