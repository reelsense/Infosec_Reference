* [Smart TV Security - #1984 in 21 st century](https://cansecwest.com/slides/2013/SmartTV%20Security.pdf)

  * This talk is more about security bugs and rootkits than about firmware for
    TVs. This talk more covers rootkits than security bugs and exploitation
    thereof, as theyre not different to traditional techniques. This talk is
    about general security issues of all Smart TV vendors.

    demonstrate how parking meter smart cards implement their protocol and will
    point out some weaknesses in their design that open the doors to the system.
    It will also present schematics and code that you can use to perform these
    basic techniques for auditing almost any type of blackblox secure memory
    card.

  * Interested in hardware hacking but not quite sure where to start? Does the
    thought of soldering thrill you (or scare you)? Come check out this talk to
    see just how easy it is to jump into this exciting field of research! Many
    people and companies use similar models of hardware. Unlike software, these
    devices rarely receive security updates. Sometimes, used devices are sold
    without clearing the configurations and important data is left behind. After
    this talk, you will know how to find hidden interfaces on these devices,
    start searching for vulnerabilities and sensitive information, and have
    irresistible urges to go home and tear apart all your old networking
    equipment. Did we mention...live demo?

  * The next big market push is to have the cool IoT device thats connected to
    the internet. As weve seen from the Mirai and Switcher hacks, its important
    to embed the appropriate safeguards so that devices are not open to attack.
    When selecting device components there are things that should be checked
    for, and when youre doing the coding and workflows, there are other things
    that need to be taken in to account. Although security and privacy are close
    cousins, theyre also different. This talk will be centered around some best
    security and privacy practices as well as some common errors that should be
    avoided.

  * Despite claims of its obsolescence, electrical glitching can be a viable
    attack vector against some ICs. This presentation chronicles a quest to
    learn what types of electrical transients can be introduced into an
    integrated circuit to cause a variety of circuit faults advantageous to an
    reverser. Several hardware platforms were constructed during the quest to
    aid in research, including old-skool & solderless breadboards, photo-etched
    & professional PCBs, FPGAs, and cheap & dirty homemade logic analyzers. The
    strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches will be discussed.

* [PCILeech](https://github.com/ufrisk/pcileech)

  * The PCILeech use the USB3380 chip in order to read from and write to the
    memory of a target system. This is achieved by using DMA over PCI Express.
    No drivers are needed on the target system. The USB3380 is only able to read
    4GB of memory natively, but is able to read all memory if a kernel module
    (KMD) is first inserted into the target system kernel. Reading 8GB of memory
    from the target system take around one (1) minute. The PCILeech hardware is
    connected with USB3 to a controlling computer running the PCILeech program.
    PCILeech is also capable of inserting a wide range of kernel modules into
    the targeted kernels - allowing for pulling and pushing files, remove the
    logon password requirement, loading unsigned drivers, executing code and
    spawn system shells. The software is written in visual studio and runs on
    Windows 7/Windows 10. Supported target systems are currently the x64
    versions of: Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows.

  * Abstract: Increased focus on the Universal Serial Bus (USB) attack surface
    of devices has recently resulted in a number of new vulnerabilities. Much of
    this advance has been aided by the advent of hardware-based USB emulation
    techniques. However, existing tools and methods are far from ideal,
    requiring a significant investment of time, money, and effort. In this work,
    we present a USB testing framework that improves significantly over existing
    methods in providing a cost-effective and flexible way to read and modify
    USB communication. Amongst other benefits, the framework enables
    man-in-the-middle fuzz testing between a host and peripheral. We achieve
    this by performing two-way emulation using inexpensive bespoke USB testing
    hardware, thereby delivering capa-bilities of a USB analyzer at a tenth of
    the cost. Mutational fuzzing is applied during live communication between a
    host and peripheral, yielding new security-relevant bugs. Lastly, we comment
    on the potential of the framework to improve current exploitation techniques
    on the USB channel.

* [USB For All - Defcon 22 - Jesse Michael and Mickey Shkatov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HnQnpJwr-c)

  * USB is used in almost every computing device produced in recent years. In
    addition to well-known usages like keyboard, mouse, and mass storage, a much
    wider range of capabilities exist such as Device Firmware Update, USB
    On-The-Go, debug over USB, and more. What actually happens on the wire? Is
    there interesting data we can observe or inject into these operations that
    we can take advantage of? In this talk, we will present an overview of USB
    and its corresponding attack surface. We will demonstrate different tools
    and methods that can be used to monitor and abuse USB for malicious
    purposes.

### General Papers

* [Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans](http://sharps.org/wp-content/uploads/BECKER-CHES.pdf)

  * Abstract: In this paper we propose an extremely stealthy approach for
    implement- ing hardware Trojans below the gate level, and we evaluate their
    impact on the security of the target device. Instead of adding additional
    cir- cuitry to the target design, we insert our hardware Trojans by changing
    the dopant polarity of existing transistors. Since the modi ed circuit ap-
    pears legitimate on all wiring layers (including all metal and polysilicon),
    our family of Trojans is resistant to most detection techniques, includ- ing
    ne-grain optical inspection and checking against \golden chips". We
    demonstrate the e ectiveness of our approach by inserting Trojans into two
    designs | a digital post-processing derived from Intel's cryp- tographically
    secure RNG design used in the Ivy Bridge processors and a side-channel
    resistant SBox implementation | and by exploring their detectability and
    their e ects on security.

* [Perimeter-Crossing Buses: a New Attack Surface for Embedded Systems](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sws/pubs/bgjss12.pdf)

  * Abstract: This paper maps out the bus-facing attack surface of a modern
    operating system, and demonstrates that effective and effcient injection of
    traffc into the buses is real and easily a ordable. Further, it presents a
    simple and inexpen-sive hardware tool for the job, outlining the
    architectural and computation-theoretic challenges to creating a defensive
    OS/driver architecture comparable to that which has been achieved for
    network stacks.

* [Implementation and Implications of a Stealth Hard-Drive Backdoor](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/kurmus/papers/acsac13.pdf)

  * Modern workstations and servers implicitly trust hard disks to act as
    well-behaved block devices. This paper analyzes the catastrophic loss of
    security that occurs when hard disks are not trustworthy. First, we show
    that it is possible to compromise the firmware of a commercial ovt-the-shelf
    hard drive, by resorting only to public information and reverse engineering.
    Using such a compromised firmware, we present a stealth rootkit that
    replaces arbitrary blocks from the disk while they are written, providing a
    data replacement back- door . The measured performance overhead of the
    compromised disk drive is less than 1% compared with a normal, non-malicious
    disk drive. We then demonstrate that a re- mote attacker can even establish
    a communication channel with a compromised disk to infiltrate commands and
    to ex-filtrate data. In our example, this channel is established over the
    Internet to an unmodified web server that relies on the compromised drive
    for its storage, passing through the original webserver, database server,
    database storage engine, filesystem driver, and block device driver.
    Additional experiments, performed in an emulated disk-drive environment,
    could automatically extract sensitive data such as /etc/shadow (or a secret
    key le) in less than a minute. This paper claims that the diffculty of
    implementing such an at- tack is not limited to the area of government
    cyber-warfare; rather, it is well within the reach of moderately funded
    criminals, botnet herders and academic researchers.

* [Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them: An Experimental Study of DRAM Disturbance Errors](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~safari/pubs/kim-isca14.pdf)

  * Abstract. Memory isolation is a key property of a reliable and secure
    computing system an access to one memory ad- dress should not have
    unintended side e ects on data stored in other addresses. However, as DRAM
    process technology scales down to smaller dimensions, it becomes more
    diffcult to prevent DRAM cells from electrically interacting with each
    other. In this paper, we expose the vulnerability of commodity DRAM chips to
    disturbance errors. By reading from the same address in DRAM, we show that
    it is possible to corrupt data in nearby addresses. More specifically,
    activating the same row in DRAM corrupts data in nearby rows. We demonstrate
    this phenomenon on Intel and AMD systems using a malicious program that
    generates many DRAM accesses. We induce errors in most DRAM modules (110 out
    of 129) from three major DRAM manufacturers. From this we conclude that many
    deployed systems are likely to be at risk. We identify the root cause of
    disturbance errors as the repeated toggling of a DRAM rows wordline, which
    stresses inter-cell coupling e ects that accelerate charge leakage from
    nearby rows. We provide an extensive characterization study of disturbance
    errors and their behavior using an FPGA-based testing plat- form. Among our
    key findings, we show that (i) it takes as few as 139K accesses to induce an
    error and (ii) up to one in every 1.7K cells is susceptible to errors. After
    examining var- ious potential ways of addressing the problem, we propose a
    low-overhead solution to prevent the errors.

* [Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU Architectures](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/35649.pdf)

  * Software Fault Isolation (SFI) is an effective approach to sandboxing binary
    code of questionable provenance, an interesting use case for native plugins
    in a Web browser. We present software fault isolation schemes for ARM and
    x86-64 that provide control-flow and memory integrity with average
    performance overhead of under 5% on ARM and 7% on x86-64. We believe these
    are the best known SFI implementations for these architectures, with
    significantly lower overhead than previous systems for similar
    architectures. Our experience suggests that these SFI implementations
    benefit from instruction-level parallelism, and have particularly small
    impact for work- loads that are data memory-bound, both properties that tend
    to reduce the impact of our SFI systems for future CPU implementations.

* [The Sorcerers Apprentice Guide to Fault Attacks](https://eprint.iacr.org/2004/100.pdf)

  * The effect of faults on electronic systems has been studied since the 1970s
    when it was noticed that radioactive particles caused errors in chips. This
    led to further research on the effect of charged particles on silicon,
    motivated by the aerospace industry who was becoming concerned about the
    effect of faults in airborne electronic systems. Since then various
    mechanisms for fault creation and propagation have been discovered and
    researched. This paper covers the various methods that can be used to induce
    faults in semiconductors and exploit such errors maliciously. Several
    examples of attacks stemming from the exploiting of faults are explained.
    Finally a series of countermeasures to thwart these attacks are described.
