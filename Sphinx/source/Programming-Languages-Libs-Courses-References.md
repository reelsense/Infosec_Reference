### General

The content here is just stuff I've come across or think would be useful to
someone in infosec. It is not to be taken as anything beyond a suggestion about
stuff.

* [Secure Coding Standards - Android](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=111509535)
* [Secure Coding Cheat Sheet - OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Coding_Cheat_Sheet)
* [What a C programmer should know about memory](http://marek.vavrusa.com/c/memory/2015/02/20/memory/)
* [How to be a Programmer: Community Version](https://github.com/braydie/HowToBeAProgrammer)

  * To be a good programmer is difficult and noble. The hardest part of making
    real a collective vision of a software project is dealing with one's
    coworkers and customers. Writing computer programs is important and takes
    great intelligence and skill. But it is really child's play compared to
    everything else that a good programmer must do to make a software system
    that succeeds for both the customer and myriad colleagues for whom he or she
    is partially responsible. In this essay I attempt to summarize as concisely
    as possible those things that I wish someone had explained to me when I was
    twenty-one.

* [Loop Patterns](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/patterns/plopd/loops.html#loop-and-a-half)

* [App Ideas - Stuff to build out ot improve your programming skills](https://github.com/tastejs/awesome-app-ideas)
* [Secure iOS application development](https://github.com/felixgr/secure-ios-app-dev)

  * This guide is a collection of the most common vulnerabilities found in iOS
    applications. The focus is on vulnerabilities in the applications’ code and
    only marginally covers general iOS system security, Darwin security,
    C/ObjC/C++ memory safety, or high-level application security. Nevertheless,
    hopefully the guide can serve as training material to iOS app developers
    that want to make sure that they ship a more secure app. Also, iOS security
    reviewers can use it as a reference during assessments.

* [Mostly Adequate Guide](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/)

  * This is a book on the functional paradigm in general. We'll use the world's
    most popular functional programming language: JavaScript. Some may feel this
    is a poor choice as it's against the grain of the current culture which, at
    the moment, feels predominately imperative.

* [Six Stages of debugging](http://plasmasturm.org/log/6debug/)

```
    1. That can’t happen.
    2. That doesn’t happen on my machine.
    3. That shouldn’t happen.
    4. Why does that happen?
    5. Oh, I see.
    6. How did that ever work?

### Talks/Videos

* [Big picture software testing unit testing, Lean Startup, and everything in between PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vaq_e7qUA-4&feature=youtu.be&t=63s)
* [Boundaries - By Gary Bernhardt from SCNA 2012](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries)

  * This talk is about using simple values (as opposed to complex objects) not
    just for holding data, but also as the boundaries between components and
    subsystems. It moves through many topics: functional programming;
    mutability's relationship to OO; isolated unit testing with and without test
    doubles; and concurrency, to name some bar. The "Functional Core, Imperative
    Shell" screencast mentioned at the end is available as part of season 4 of
    the DAS catalog.

* [Big picture software testing unit testing, Lean Startup, and everything in between PyCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vaq_e7qUA-4&feature=youtu.be&t=63s)

  * There are many ways you can test your software: unit testing, manual
    testing, end-to-end testing, and so forth. Take a step back and you'll
    discover even more form of testing, many of them very different in their
    goals: A/B testing, say, where you see which of two versions of your website
    results in more signups or ad clicks. How do these forms of testing differ,
    how do they relate to each other? How do you choose which kind of testing to
    pursue, given limited time and resources? How do you deal with strongly held
    yet opposite views arguing either that a particular kind of testing is
    essential or that it's a waste time? This talk will provide you with a
    model, a way to organize all forms of testing and understand what exactly
    they provide, and why. Once you understand the model you will be able to
    choose the right form of testing for _your_ situation and goals.

### sca Source Code Analysis

* Tools

  * [RIPS](http://rips-scanner.sourceforge.net/)
    * RIPS is a tool written in PHP to find vulnerabilities in PHP applications
      using static code analysis. By tokenizing and parsing all source code
      files RIPS is able to transform PHP source code into a program model and
      to detect sensitive sinks (potentially vulnerable functions) that can be
      tainted by user input (influenced by a malicious user) during the program
      flow. Besides the structured output of found vulnerabilities RIPS also
      offers an integrated code audit framework for further manual analysis.
  * [PHPMD - PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org/about.html) \* What PHPMD does
    is: It takes a given PHP source code base and look for several potential
    problems within that source. These problems can be things like: Possible
    bugs; Suboptimal code; Overcomplicated expressions; Unused parameters,
    methods, properties.
  * [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net/)
    * PMD is a source code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws like
      unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so
      forth. It supports Java, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML, XSL.
      Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds
      duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript,
      PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Ruby, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go.
  * [Graudit](http://www.justanotherhacker.com/projects/graudit.html)
    * Graudit is a simple script and signature sets that allows you to find
      potential security flaws in source code using the GNU utility grep. It's
      comparable to other static analysis applications like RATS, SWAAT and
      flaw-finder while keeping the technical requirements to a minimum and
      being very flexible.
  * [PumaScan](https://github.com/pumasecurity/puma-scan)
    * provides real time, continuous source code analysis
  * [How to find 56 potential vulnerabilities in FreeBSD code in one evening](https://www.viva64.com/en/b/0496/)
  * [Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan)
    * Phan is a static analyzer for PHP. Phan prefers to avoid false-positives
      and attempts to prove incorrectness rather than correctness.

      coverage is pretty quick, so it is most appropriate for someone with some
      programming background who needs to see how C works. Topics include
      variables, int types, floating point types, promotion, truncation,
      operators, control structures (if, while, for), functions, value
      parameters, reference parameters, structs, pointers, arrays, the
      pre-processor, and the standard C library functions. (revised 4/2003)

      and memory work and how to use them -- from the basic concepts through all
      the major programming techniques. Can be used as an introduction to
      pointers for someone with basic programming experience or as a quick
      review. Many advanced programming and debugging problems only make sense
      with a solid understanding of pointers and memory -- this document tries
      to provide that understanding.

  * [Lua code: security overview and practical approaches to static analysis](http://spw17.langsec.org/papers/costin-lua-static-analysis.pdf)

    * Abstract — Lua is an interpreted, cross-platform, embeddable, performant
      and low-footprint language. Lua’s popularity is on the rise in the last
      couple of years. Simple design and efficient usage of resources combined
      with its performance make it attractive or production web applications
      even to big organizations such as Wikipedia, CloudFlare and GitHub. In
      addition to this, Lua is one of the preferred choices for programming
      embedded and IoT devices. This context allows to assume a large and
      growing Lua codebase yet to be assessed. This growing Lua codebase could
      be potentially driving production servers and extremely large number of
      devices, some perhaps with mission-critical function for example in
      automotive or home-automation domains. However, there is a substantial and
      obvious lack of static analysis tools and vulnerable code corpora for Lua
      as compared to other increasingly popular languages, such as PHP, Python
      and JavaScript. Even the state-of-the-art commercial tools that support
      dozens of languages and technologies actually do not support Lua static
      code analysis. In this paper we present the first public Static Analysis
      for SecurityTesting (SAST) tool for Lua code that is currently focused on
      web vulnerabilities. We show its potential with good and promising
      preliminary results that we obtained on simple and intentionally
      vulnerable Lua code samples that we synthesized for our experiments. We
      also present and release our synthesized corpus of intentionally
      vulnerable Lua code, as well as the testing setups used in our experiments
      in form of virtual and completely reproducible environments. We hope our
      work can spark additional and renewed interest in this apparently
      overlooked area of language security and static analysis, as well as
      motivate community’s contribution to these open-source projects. The tool,
      the samples and the testing VM setups will be released and updated at
      http://lua.re and http://lua.rocks

      * Python is a popular language and that is true as well within the
        Security industry. This talk will outline how Python code can be
        statically analyzed using publicly available tools such as bandit. It
        will then take a more technical approach and outline how the abstract
        syntax tree (AST) can be processed and searched based on behavior clues
        to identify potential security issues. Many security tools search for
        vulnerabilities by analyzing the contents of static strings and
        examining their variable names. This alternative approach instead
        demonstrates how the AST can be analyzed to identify pieces of sensitive
        information such as encryption keys and passwords based on matching them
        with usage patterns. This will be a technical talk focused on using
        automated techniques to find security vulnerabilities in Python
        projects. The audience will leave with an understanding of these
        techniques and how they can be applied to the projects they are either
        developing themselves or using in their daily routines. This talk will
        end with a live demonstration of a forked version of the public Bandit
        scanner where these techniques have been implemented.

  * [Hachoir](https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/wiki/Home)
    * Hachoir is a Python library that allows to view and edit a binary stream
      field by field
  * [Equip: python bytecode instrumentation](https://github.com/neuroo/equip)
    * equip is a small library that helps with Python bytecode instrumentation.
      Its API is designed to be small and flexible to enable a wide range of
      possible instrumentations. The instrumentation is designed around the
      injection of bytecode inside the bytecode of the program to be
      instrumented. However, the developer does not need to know anything about
      the Python bytecode since the injected code is Python source.
  * [Construct2](https://github.com/construct/construct)
    * Construct is a powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.
      Instead of writing imperative code to parse a piece of data, you
      declaratively define a data structure that describes your data. As this
      data structure is not code, you can use it in one direction to parse data
      into Pythonic objects, and in the other direction, convert ("build")
      objects into binary data.
  * [Impacket](https://github.com/CoreSecurity/impacket)
    * Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network
      protocols. Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access
      to the packets and for some protocols (for instance NMB, SMB1-3 and
      MS-DCERPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be constructed
      from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API
      makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library
      provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context
      of this library.

* [Shellpaste](https://github.com/andrew-morris/shellpaste)

  * Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes
    it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV
    doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing
    this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being
    said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests
    when conventional malware fails.
