## Counter Surveillance

I am not a professional and may be a twelve year old child. Be wary.

  * We've all seen the steady stream of revelations about the NSA's
    unconstitutional, illegal mass surveillance. Seems like there's a new
    transgression revealed every week! I'm getting outrage fatigue. So I decided
    to fight back... by looking for practical, realistic, everyday actions I can
    take to protect my privacy and civil liberties on the Internet, and sharing
    them with my friends. Join me in using encryption and privacy technology to
    resist eavesdropping and tracking, and to start to opt out of the bulk data
    collection that the NSA has unilaterally decided to secretly impose upon the
    world. Let's take back the Internet, one encrypted bit at a time.

  * This short talk will cover the standards, devices and implementation of a
    mandatory part of our western Internet infrastructure. The central question
    is whether an overarching interception functionality might actually put
    national Internet infrastructure at a higher risk of being attacked
    successfully. The question is approached in this talk from a purely
    technical point of view, looking at how LI functionality is implemented by a
    major vendor and what issues arise from that implementation. Routers and
    other devices may get hurt in the process.

### Papers

* [Exploiting Lawful Intercept to Wiretap the Internet](https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-dc-10/Cross_Tom/BlackHat-DC-2010-Cross-Attacking-LawfulI-Intercept-wp.pdf)

  * This paper will review Cisco's architecture for lawful intercept from
    asecurity perspective. We explain how a number of different weaknesses in
    its design coupled with publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities could
    enable a malicious person to access the interface and spy on communications
    without leaving a trace. We then provide a set of recommendations for the
    redesign of the interface as well as SNMP authentication in general to
    better mitigate the security risks.
