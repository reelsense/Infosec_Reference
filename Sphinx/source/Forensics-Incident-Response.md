### General

* Better security -> Mean time to detect/Mean time to respond
* [IRM (Incident Response Methodologies)](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/IRM)

  * CERT Societe Generale provides easy to use operational incident best
    practices. These cheat sheets are dedicated to incident handling and cover
    multiple fields in which a CERT team can be involved. One IRM exists for
    each security incident we're used to dealing with.

* [Introduction to DFIR](https://sroberts.github.io/2016/01/11/introduction-to-dfir-the-beginning/)
* [File Signature Table](http://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html)

  * This table of file signatures (aka "magic numbers") is a continuing
    work-in-progress. I have found little information on this in a single place,
    with the exception of the table in Forensic Computing: A Practitioner's
    Guide by T. Sammes & B. Jenkinson (Springer, 2000); that was my inspiration
    to start this list in 2002. See also Wikipedia's List of file signatures.
    Comments, additions, and queries can be sent to Gary Kessler at
    gck@garykessler.net.

* [IRMA - Incident Response & Malware Analysis](http://irma.quarkslab.com/index.html)

  * IRMA intends to be an open-source platform designed to help identifying and
    analyzing malicious files. However, today's defense is not only about
    learning about a file, but it is also getting a fine overview of the
    incident you dealt with: where / when a malicious file has been seen, who
    submitted a hash, where a hash has been noticed, which anti-virus detects
    it, ... An important value with IRMA comes from you keep control over where
    goes / who gets your data. Once you install IRMA on your network, your data
    stays on your network. Each submitted files is analyzed in various ways. For
    now, we focus our efforts on multiple anti-virus engines, but we are working
    on other "probes" (feel free to submit your own).

    (ssdeep)

* [PDF Tools - Didier Stevens](http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/pdf-tools/)
* [Xmount](https://www.pinguin.lu/xmount)

  * What is xmount? xmount allows you to convert on-the-fly between multiple
    input and output harddisk image types. xmount creates a virtual file system
    using FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) that contains a virtual representation
    of the input image. The virtual representation can be in raw DD, DMG, VHD,
    VirtualBox's virtual disk file format or in VmWare's VMDK file format. Input
    images can be raw DD, EWF (Expert Witness Compression Format) or AFF
    (Advanced Forensic Format) files. In addition, xmount also supports virtual
    write access to the output files that is redirected to a cache file. This
    makes it possible to boot acquired harddisk images using QEMU, KVM,
    VirtualBox, VmWare or alike.

* [triage-ir](https://code.google.com/p/triage-ir/)

  * Triage: Incident Response automatically collect information from a system
    that needs basic triage functions performed upon it. The script allows for
    easy modification for customization to your needs, in an easy to comprehend
    and implement language. This tool uses a lot others to get its information.
    Eventually I hope to eliminate the need for them, but use them as
    verification. This tool requires you to download the Sysinternals Suite if
    you want full functionality to it.

* [Fully Integrated Defense Operation (FIDO)](https://github.com/Netflix/Fido)

  * FIDO is an orchestration layer used to automate the incident response
    process by evaluating, assessing and responding to malware. FIDO’s primary
    purpose is to handle the heavy manual effort needed to evaluate threats
    coming from today's security stack and the large number of alerts generated
    by them. As an orchestration platform FIDO can make using your existing
    security tools more efficient and accurate by heavily reducing the manual
    effort needed to detect, notify and respond to attacks against a network.

* [Investigating PowerShell Attacks - Ryan Kazanciyan and Matt Hastings - DEFCON22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF06PFcezLs)

  * This presentation will focus on common attack patterns performed through
    PowerShell - such as lateral movement, remote command execution,
    reconnaissance, file transfer, etc. - and the sources of evidence they leave
    behind. We'll demonstrate how to collect and interpret these forensic
    artifacts, both on individual hosts and at scale across the enterprise.
    Throughout the presentation, we'll include examples from real-world
    incidents and recommendations on how to limit exposure to these attacks.

* [Human Hunting](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidessf2015/108-human-hunting-sean-gillespie)

  * Much of what appears to be happening in information security seems to be
    focused on replacing humans with magic boxes and automation rather than
    providing tools to augment human capabilities. However, when we look at good
    physical security we see technology is being used to augment human
    capabilities rather than simply replace them. The adversary is human so we
    are ultimately looking for human directed behaviors. If analysts don't know
    how to go looking for evil without automated detection tools then they are
    not going to be able to effectively evaluate if the detection tools are
    working properly or if the deployment was properly engineered. An over
    reliance on automated detection also puts organizations in a position of
    paying protection money if they want to remain secure. We should be spending
    more resources on honing analyst hunting skills to find human adversaries
    rather than purchasing more automated defenses for human adversaries to
    bypass.

* [Anti-Forensics and Anti-Anti-Forensics Attacks - Michael Perkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4x8Hz6_hq0)

  * Everyone's heard the claim: Security through obscurity is no security at
    all. Challenging this claim is the entire field of steganography itself -
    the art of hiding things in plain sight. Most people know you can hide a
    text file inside a photograph, or embed a photograph inside an MP3. But how
    does this work under the hood? What's new in the stego field? This talk will
    explore how various techniques employed by older steganographic tools work
    and will discuss a new technique developed by the speaker which embodies
    both data hiding and data enciphering properties by encoding data inside
    NTFS volumes. A new tool will be released during this talk that will allow
    attendees to both encode and decode data with this new scheme.

  * The largest organizations in the world rely on SAP platforms to run their
    critical processes and keep their business crown jewels: financial
    information, customer data, intellectual property, credit cards, human
    resources salaries, sensitive materials, suppliers and more. Everything is
    there and attackers know it. For several years at Onapsis we have been
    researching on how cyber-criminals might be able to break into ERP systems
    in order to help organizations better protect themselves. This has enabled
    us to gain a unique expertise on which are the most critical attack vectors
    and what kind of traces they leave (and don’t) over the victim’s SAP
    platforms. SAP systems need to be ready for Forensic Analysis, so the big
    question is: Are your systems prepared to retain the attackers breadcrumbs
    in the event of an attack? Join us and learn how to do a forensic analysis
    of an SAP system, looking for traces of a security breach We will also show
    novel techniques being used by attackers to avoid being detected during post
    attack forensic investigations. Vulnerabilities related to anti-forensic
    techniques will be presented together with their mitigation. **NEW** New
    attacks never presented before will be shown. JAVA, ABAP and BO systems will
    be covered.

  * Each time that you run an application in your system, a Prefetch file which
    contains information about the files loaded by the application is created by
    Windows operating system. The information in the Prefetch file is used for
    optimizing the loading time of the application in the next time that you run
    it. WinPrefetchView is a small utility that reads the Prefetch files stored
    in your system and display the information stored in them. By looking in
    these files, you can learn which files every application is using, and which
    files are loaded on Windows boot.

* [Event Tracing for Windows and Network Monitor](http://blogs.technet.com/b/netmon/archive/2009/05/13/event-tracing-for-windows-and-network-monitor.aspx)

  * "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as
    it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that
    describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it’s something like the
    proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in
    retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL
    (Event Trace Log) file. What’s new is that that Network Monitor can read any
    ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers
    can be decoded."
