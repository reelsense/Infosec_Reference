* Handy Tools

  * [pngcheck](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngcheck.html)
    * pngcheck verifies the integrity of PNG, JNG and MNG files (by checking the
      internal 32-bit CRCs [checksums] and decompressing the image data); it can
      optionally dump almost all of the chunk-level information in the image in
      human-readable form. For example, it can be used to print the basic
      statistics about an image (dimensions, bit depth, etc.); to list the color
      and transparency info in its palette (assuming it has one); or to extract
      the embedded text annotations. This is a command-line program with batch
      capabilities.
