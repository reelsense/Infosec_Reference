* [Pentesting iOS Applications - Pentester Academy](http://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=2)

  * Paid Course
  * This course focuses on the iOS platform and application security and is
    ideal for pentesters, researchers and the casual iOS enthusiast who would
    like to dive deep and understand how to analyze and systematically audit
    applications on this platform using a variety of bleeding edge tools and
    techniques.

* [Secure iOS application development](https://github.com/felixgr/secure-ios-app-dev)

  * This guide is a collection of the most common vulnerabilities found in iOS
    applications. The focus is on vulnerabilities in the applications’ code and
    only marginally covers general iOS system security, Darwin security,
    C/ObjC/C++ memory safety, or high-level application security. Nevertheless,
    hopefully the guide can serve as training material to iOS app developers
    that want to make sure that they ship a more secure app. Also, iOS security
    reviewers can use it as a reference during assessments.

  * Needle is an open source, modular framework to streamline the process of
    conducting security assessments of iOS apps.

### Vulnerabilities/Exploits

* [List of iOS Exploits](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Category:Exploits)

### Techniques

### Training & Tutorials

* [iOSRE](https://github.com/kpwn/iOSRE)

  * The aim of this project is to provide useful and updated tools and knowledge
    on iOS reverse engineering and exploitation. This is an ongoing effort, and
    still in a very new stage.

* [OWASP iOS crackme tutorial: Solved with Frida](https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2017/04/27/owasp-ios-crackme-tutorial-frida/)

* [Bypassing SSL Cert Pinning in iOS](http://chargen.matasano.com/chargen/2015/1/6/bypassing-openssl-certificate-pinning-in-ios-apps.html)
* [Learning iOS Application Security - 34 part series - damnvulnerableiosapp](http://damnvulnerableiosapp.com/#learn)

  * iOS app designed to be vulnerable in specific ways to teach security testing
    of iOS applications.

* [Damn Vulnerable iOS App - Getting Started](http://damnvulnerableiosapp.com/2013/12/get-started/)

* [OWASP iGOAT](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_iGoat_Project)

  * iGoat is a safe environment where iOS developers can learn about the major
    security pitfalls they face as well as how to avoid them. It is made up of a
    series of lessons that each teach a single (but vital) security lesson.

### iOS Security Testing Methodologies/Tools

* [iPwn Apps: Pentesting iOS Applications - SANS](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/ipwn-apps-pentesting-ios-applications-34577)

* [iOS Application Security Testing Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/IOS_Application_Security_Testing_Cheat_Sheet)

* [idb](https://github.com/dmayer/idb)

  * idb is a tool to simplify some common tasks for iOS pentesting and research.
    It is still a work in progress but already provides a bunch of (hopefully)
    useful commands. The goal was to provide all (or most) functionality for
    both, iDevices and the iOS simulator. For this, a lot is abstracted
    internally to make it work transparently for both environments. Although
    recently the focus has been more on supporting devices.

### General Research Papers

* [Write-up for alloc8: untethered bootrom exploit for iPhone 3GS](https://github.com/axi0mX/alloc8)

### Reverse Engineering

* [IODIDE - The IOS Debugger and Integrated Disassembler Environment](https://github.com/nccgroup/IODIDE)
* [Clutch - Fast iOS executable dumper](https://github.com/KJCracks/Clutch)
* [MEMSCAN - Dump iPhone app RAM](http://www.cigital.com/justice-league-blog/2015/02/18/memscan-defined/)

  * A Cigital consultant – Grant Douglas, recently created a utility called
    MEMSCAN which enables users to dump the memory contents of a given iPhone
    app. Dumping the memory contents of a process proves to be a useful
    technique in identifying keys and credentials in memory. Using the utility,
    users are able to recover keys or secrets that are statically protected
    within the application but are less protected at runtime. Users can also use
    the utility to verify that keys and credentials are appropriately disposed
    of after use.

* [MEMSCAN](https://github.com/hexploitable/MEMSCAN)

  * A memory scanning tool which uses mach_vm to either dump memory or look for
    a specific sequence of bytes.

### Jailbreaking

* [Guide to hardening iOS with the goal of privacy](http://cydia.radare.org/sec/)

* [IPhoneDevWiki](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page)

  * Our goal is to share the sum of all human[1] knowledge about jailbroken iOS
    development. In other words, this is a collection of documentation written
    by developers to help each other write extensions (tweaks) for jailbroken
    iOS, and you're invited to learn from it and contribute to it too.

* [The iPhone Wiki](http://theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Main_Page)

  * The iPhone Wiki is an unofficial wiki dedicated to collecting, storing and
    providing information on the internals of Apple's amazing iDevices. We hope
    to pass this information on to the next generation of hackers so that they
    can go forth into their forebears' footsteps and break the ridiculous bonds
    Apple has put on their amazing mobile devices.
