  * The purpose of this document is to assist organizations in planning and
    conducting technical information security tests and examinations, analyzing
    findings, and developing mitigation strategies. The guide provides practical
    recommendations for designing, implementing, and maintaining technical
    information security test and examination processes and procedures. These
    can be used for several purposes, such as finding vulnerabilities in a
    system or network and verifying compliance with a policy or other
    requirements. The guide is not intended to present a comprehensive
    information security testing and examination program but rather an overview
    of key elements of technical security testing and examination, with an
    emphasis on specific technical techniques, the benefits and limitations of
    each, and recommendations for their use.
