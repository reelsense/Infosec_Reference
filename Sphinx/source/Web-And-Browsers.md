#### To-do

* Fix ToC
* Add CSP -
  [Intro to content Security Policy](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/)
* Add SOAP
* Clickjack(ing)
* [Postcards from a Post-XSS World - Michael Zalewski](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/postxss/#dangling-markup-injection)

  * This page is a rough collection of notes on some of the fundamental
    alternatives to direct script injection that would be available to attackers
    following the universal deployment of CSP or other security mechanisms
    designed to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts. I hope to
    demonstrate that in many cases, the capabilities offered by these
    alternative methods are highly compatible with the goals of contemporary XSS
    attacks.

* [The Tale of a Fameless but Widespread Web Vulnerability Class - Veit Hailperin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qA0CtS6cZ4)

  * Two keys components account for finding vulnerabilities of a certain class:
    awareness of the vulnerability and ease of finding the vulnerability.
    Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerabilities are not mentioned in the
    de facto standard for public attention - the OWASP Top 10. Additionally
    there is no public tool available to facilitate finding XSSI. The impact
    reaches from leaking personal information stored, circumvention of
    token-based protection to complete compromise of accounts. XSSI
    vulnerabilities are fairly wide spread and the lack of detection increases
    the risk of each XSSI. In this talk we are going to demonstrate how to find
    XSSI, exploit XSSI and also how to protect against XSSI.

* [Backslash Powered Scanning: Hunting Unknown Vulnerability Classes](http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/11/backslash-powered-scanning-hunting.html)

  * Existing web scanners search for server-side injection vulnerabilities by
    throwing a canned list of technology-specific payloads at a target and
    looking for signatures - almost like an anti-virus. In this document, I'll
    share the conception and development of an alternative approach, capable of
    finding and confirming both known and unknown classes of injection
    vulnerabilities. Evolved from classic manual techniques, this approach reaps
    many of the benefits of manual testing including casual WAF evasion, a tiny
    network footprint, and flexibility in the face of input filtering.

  * As a part of an ongoing investigation on Adobe Flash SOP bypass techniques,
    we identified a vulnerability affecting old releases of the Adobe Flex SDK
    compiler. Further investigation traced the issue back to a well known
    vulnerability (CVE20112461), already patched by Adobe. Old vulnerability,
    let's move on? Not this time. CVE20112461 is a very interesting bug. As long
    as the SWF file was compiled with a vulnerable Flex SDK, attackers can still
    use this vulnerability against the latest web browsers and Flash plugin.
    Even with the most recent updates, vulnerable Flex applications hosted on
    your domain can be exploited. In this presentation, we will disclose the
    details of this vulnerability (Adobe has never released all technicalities)
    and we will discuss how we conducted a large scale analysis on popular
    websites, resulting in the identification of numerous Alexa Top 50 sites
    vulnerable to this bug. Finally, we will also release a custom tool and a
    Burp plugin capable of detecting vulnerable SWF applications. \* Advanced

  * In this paper, we study code reuse attacks in the con- text of PHP-based web
    applications. We analyze how PHP object injection (POI) vulnerabilities can
    be exploited via property-oriented programming (POP) and perform a
    systematic analysis of available gadgets in common PHP applications.
    Furthermore, we introduce an automated approach to statically detect POI
    vulnerabilities in object-oriented PHP code. Our approach is also capable of
    generating POP chains in an automated way. We implemented a prototype of the
    proposed approach and evaluated it with 10 well-known applications. Overall,
    we detected 30 new POI vulnerabilities and 28 new gadget chains

  * RPO (Relative Path Overwrite) is a technique to take advantage of relative
    URLs by overwriting their target file. To understand the technique we must
    first look into the differences between relative and absolute URLs. An
    absolute URL is basically the full URL for a destination address including
    the protocol and domain name whereas a relative URL doesn’t specify a domain
    or protocol and uses the existing destination to determine the protocol and
    domain.

* [The Spy in the Sandbox – Practical Cache Attacks in Javascript](http://iss.oy.ne.ro/SpyInTheSandbox.pdf)

  * We present the first micro-architectural side-channel at- tack which runs
    entirely in the browser. In contrast to other works in this genre, this
    attack does not require the attacker to install any software on the victim’s
    machine – to facilitate the attack, the victim needs only to browse to an
    untrusted webpage with attacker-controlled con- tent. This makes the attack
    model highly scalable and ex- tremely relevant and practical to today’s web,
    especially since most desktop browsers currently accessing the In- ternet
    are vulnerable to this attack. Our attack, which is an extension of the
    last-level cache attacks of Yarom et al. [23], allows a remote adversary
    recover information belonging to other processes, other users and even other
    virtual machines running on the same physical host as the victim web
    browser. We describe the fundamentals behind our attack, evaluate its
    performance using a high bandwidth covert channel and finally use it to
    construct a system-wide mouse/network activity logger. Defending against
    this attack is possible, but the required counter- measures can exact an
    impractical cost on other benign uses of the web browser and of the
    computer.

* [Self-Exfiltration: The Dangers of Browser-Enforced Information Flow Control](http://ericchen.me/self_exfiltration.pdf)

  * Abstract —Since the early days of Netscape, browser vendors and web security
    researchers have restricted out-going data based on its destination. The
    security argument accompanying these mechanisms is that they prevent
    sensitive user data from being sent to the attacker’s domain. However, in
    this paper, we show that regulating web information flow based on its
    destination server is an inherently flawed security practice. It is
    vulnerable to self-exfiltration attacks, where an adversary stashes stolen
    information in the database of a whitelisted site, then later independently
    connects to the whitelisted site to retrieve the information. We describe
    eight existing browser security mechanisms that are vulnerable to these
    “self-exfiltration” attacks. Furthermore, we discovered at least one
    exfiltration channel for each of the Alexa top 100 websites. None of the
    existing information flow control mechanisms we surveyed are sufficient to
    protect data from being leaked to the attacker. Our goal is to prevent
    browser vendors and researchers from falling into this trap by designing
    more systems that are vulnerable to self-exfiltration.

* [The Devil is in the Constants: Bypassing Defenses in Browser JIT Engines](http://users.ics.forth.gr/~elathan/papers/ndss15.pdf)

  * Abstract —Return-oriented programming (ROP) has become the dominant form of
    vulnerability exploitation in both user and kernel space. Many defenses
    against ROP exploits exist, which can significantly raise the bar against
    attackers. Although protecting existing code, such as applications and the
    kernel, might be possible, taking countermeasures against dynamic code,
    i.e., code that is generated only at run-time, is much harder. Attackers
    have already started exploiting Just-in-Time (JIT) engines, available in all
    modern browsers, to introduce their (shell)code (either native code or
    re-usable gadgets) during JIT compilation, and then taking advantage of it.
    Recognizing this immediate threat, browser vendors started employing
    defenses for hardening their JIT engines. In this paper, we show that—no
    matter the employed defenses—JIT engines are still exploitable using solely
    dynamically generated gadgets. We demonstrate that dynamic ROP payload
    construction is possible in two modern web browsers without using any of the
    available gadgets contained in the browser binary or linked libraries.
    First, we exploit an open source JIT engine (Mozilla Firefox) by feeding it
    malicious JavaScript, which once processed generates all re- quired gadgets
    for running any shellcode successfully. Second, we exploit a proprietary JIT
    engine, the one in the 64-bit Microsoft Internet Explorer, which employs
    many undocumented, specially crafted defenses against JIT exploitation. We
    manage to bypass all of them and create the required gadgets for running any
    shellcode successfully. All defensive techniques are documented in this
    paper to assist other researchers. Furthermore, besides showing how to
    construct ROP gadgets on-the-fly, we also show how to discover them
    on-the-fly, rendering current randomization schemes ineffective. Finally, we
    perform an analysis of the most important defense currently employed, namely
    constant blinding , which shields all three-byte or larger immediate values
    in the JIT buffer for hindering the construction of ROP gadgets. Our
    analysis suggests that extending constant blinding to all immediate values
    (i.e., shielding 1-byte and 2-byte constants) dramatically decreases the JIT
    engine’s performance, introducing up to 80% additional instructions.

* [Cookieless Monster: Exploring the Ecosystem of Web-based Device Fingerprinting](http://securitee.org/files/cookieless_sp2013.pdf)

  * Abstract —The web has become an essential part of our society and is
    currently the main medium of information delivery. Billions of users browse
    the web on a daily basis, and there are single websites that have reached
    over one billion user accounts. In this environment, the ability to track
    users and their online habits can be very lucrative for advertising
    companies, yet very intrusive for the privacy of users. In this paper, we
    examine how web-based device fingerprint- ing currently works on the
    Internet. By analyzing the code of three popular browser-fingerprinting code
    providers, we reveal the techniques that allow websites to track users
    without the need of client-side identifiers. Among these techniques, we show
    how current commercial fingerprinting approaches use questionable practices,
    such as the circumvention of HTTP proxies to discover a user’s real IP
    address and the installation of intrusive browser plugins. At the same time,
    we show how fragile the browser ecosystem is against fingerprinting through
    the use of novel browser- identifying techniques. With so many different
    vendors involved in browser development, we demonstrate how one can use
    diversions in the browsers’ implementation to distinguish successfully not
    only the browser-family, but also specific major and minor versions. Browser
    extensions that help users spoof the user-agent of their browsers are also
    evaluated. We show that current commercial approaches can bypass the
    extensions, and, in addition, take advantage of their shortcomings by using
    them as additional fingerprinting features.

    have also recognized the benefits of transport security, and they are
    increasingly turning to SSL to hide their activities . Advanced Persistent
    Threat ( APT ) attackers [ 5 ] , botnets [ 6 ] , and eve n commodity web
    attacks can leverage SSL encryption to evade detection. To counter these
    tactics, organizations are increasingly deploying security controls that
    intercept end - to - end encrypted channels. Web proxies, data loss
    prevention ( DLP ) systems, spec ialized threat detection solutions, and
    network intrusion prevention systems ( N IPS ) offer functionality to
    intercept, inspect , and filter encrypted traffic. Similar functionality is
    present in lawful intercept systems and solutions enabling the broad surve
    illance of encrypted communications by governments. Broadly classified as
    “SSL/TLS interception proxies ,” these solutions act as a “ man in the
    middle , ” violating the end - to - end security promises of SSL. This type
    of interception comes at a cost . Intercepti ng SSL - encrypted connections
    sacrifices a degree of privacy and integrity for the benefit of content
    inspection, often at the risk of authenticity and endpoint validation .
    Implementers and designers of SSL interception proxies should consider these
    risks and understand how their systems operate in unusual circumstances

* [Scriptless Attacks – Stealing the Pie Without Touching the Sill](http://www.syssec.rub.de/media/emma/veroeffentlichungen/2012/08/16/scriptlessAttacks-ccs2012.pdf)

  * Due to their high practical impact, Cross-Site Scripting (X SS) attacks have
    attracted a lot of attention from the security community members. In the
    same way, a plethora of more or less effective defense techniques have been
    proposed, ad- dressing the causes and effects of XSS vulnerabilities. As a
    result, an adversary often can no longer inject or even execute arbitrary
    scripting code in several real-life scen arios. In this paper, we examine
    the attack surface that remains after XSS and similar scripting attacks are
    supposedly mit- igated by preventing an attacker from executing JavaScript
    code. We address the question of whether an attacker really needs JavaScript
    or similar functionality to perform attac ks aiming for information theft.
    The surprising result is that an attacker can also abuse Cascading Style
    Sheets (CSS) in combination with other Web techniques like plain HTML,
    inactive SVG images or font files. Through several case studies, we
    introduce the so called scriptless attacks and demonstrate that an adversary
    might not need to execute code to preserve his ability to extract sensitive
    informati on from well protected websites. More precisely, we show that an
    attacker can use seemingly benign features to build side channel attacks
    that measure and exfiltrate almost arbitrar y data displayed on a given
    website. We conclude this paper with a discussion of potential mit- igation
    techniques against this class of attacks. In additi on, we have implemented
    a browser patch that enables a website to make a vital determination as to
    being loaded in a de- tached view or pop-up window. This approach proves
    useful for prevention of certain types of attacks we here discuss.

\*[Gone in 60 Milliseconds - Intrusion and Exfiltration in Server-less Architectures](https://media.ccc.de/v/33c3-7865-gone_in_60_milliseconds)

* More and more businesses are moving away from monolithic servers and turning
  to event-driven microservices powered by cloud function providers like AWS
  Lambda. So, how do we hack in to a server that only exists for 60
  milliseconds? This talk will show novel attack vectors using cloud event
  sources, exploitabilities in common server-less patterns and frameworks, abuse
  of undocumented features in AWS Lambda for persistent malware injection,
  identifying valuable targets for pilfering, and, of course, how to exfiltrate
  juicy data out of a secure Virtual Private Cloud.
