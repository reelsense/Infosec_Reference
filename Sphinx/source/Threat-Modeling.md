  * Everyone knows you ought to threat model, but in practical reality it turns
    out to be tricky. If past efforts to threat model haven’t panned out,
    perhaps part of the problem is confusion over what works, and how the
    various approaches conflict or align. This talk captures lessons from years
    of work helping people throughout the software industry threat model more
    effectively. It’s designed to help security pros, especially pen testers,
    all of whom will leave with both threat modeling lessons from Star Wars and
    a proven foundation, enabling them to threat model effectively on offense or
    defense.
