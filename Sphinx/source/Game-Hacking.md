### Console Hacking

#### Nintendo Gameboy

* [Reverse engineering a Gameboy ROM with radare2](https://www.megabeets.net/reverse-engineering-a-gameboy-rom-with-radare2/)

#### Nintendo 3DS

* [Keyshuffling Attack for Persistent Early Code Execution in the Nintendo 3DS Secure Bootchain](https://github.com/Plailect/keyshuffling)

  * We demonstrate an attack on the secure bootchain of the Nintendo 3DS in
    order to gain early code execution. The attack utilizes the block shuffling
    vulnerability of the ECB cipher mode to rearrange keys in the Nintendo 3DS's
    encrypted keystore. Because the shuffled keys will deterministically decrypt
    the encrypted firmware binary to incorrect plaintext data and execute it,
    and because the device's memory contents are kept between hard reboots, it
    is possible to reliably reach a branching instruction to a payload in
    memory. This payload, due to its execution by a privileged processor and its
    early execution, is able to extract the hash of hardware secrets necessary
    to decrypt the device's encrypted keystore and set up a persistant exploit
    of the system.

* [How ESEA detects cheat software in its online gaming league - Let's get physical!](http://everdox.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-esea-detects-cheat-software-in-its.html)

  * Before we dig in, this post should not be construed as an attack on ESEA,
    anti-cheat software, or fair gaming in general. It is simply an analysis
    thereof, detailing what the ESEA driver does on your machine. Although
    analysis will make attack vectors clear and obvious, no code or detailed
    explanation of how to leverage these points will be given.

* [Inside Blizzard: Battle.net](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=8&t=sumry)

  * This paper intends to describe a variety of the problems Blizzard
    Entertainment has encountered from a practical standpoint through their
    implementation of the large-scale online game matchmaking and chat service,
    Battle.net. The paper provides some background historical information into
    the design and purpose of Battle.net and continues on to discuss a variety
    of flaws that have been observed in the implementation of the system.
    Readers should come away with a better understanding of problems that can be
    easily introduced in designing a matchmaking/chat system to operate on such
    a large scale in addition to some of the serious security-related
    consequences of not performing proper parameter validation of untrusted
    clients.

* [An Objective Analysis of the Lockdown Protection System for Battle.net](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=40&t=sumry)

  * Near the end of 2006, Blizzard deployed the first major update to the
    version check and client software authentication system used to verify the
    authenticity of clients connecting to Battle.net using the binary game
    client protocol. This system had been in use since just after the release of
    the original Diablo game and the public launch of Battle.net. The new
    authentication module (Lockdown) introduced a variety of mechanisms designed
    to raise the bar with respect to spoofing a game client when logging on to
    Battle.net. In addition, the new authentication module also introduced
    run-time integrity checks of client binaries in memory. This is meant to
    provide simple detection of many client modifications (often labeled
    "hacks") that patch game code in-memory in order to modify game behavior.
    The Lockdown authentication module also introduced some anti-debugging
    techniques that are designed to make it more difficult to reverse engineer
    the module. In addition, several checks that are designed to make it
    difficult to simply load and run the Blizzard Lockdown module from the
    context of an unauthorized, non-Blizzard-game process. After all, if an
    attacker can simply load and run the Lockdown module in his or her own
    process, it becomes trivially easy to spoof the game client logon process,
    or to allow a modified game client to log on to Battle.net successfully.
    However, like any protection mechanism, the new Lockdown module is not
    without its flaws, some of which are discussed in detail in this paper.

### RE

### Talks & Presentations

* [+1,000,000 -0: Cloning a Game Using Game Hacking and Terabytes of Data](https://github.com/nickcano/gamehackingpres2016)

  * In this talk, I'll provide a window into the warchest my team used to
    generate over a million lines of code. In particular, we created and used
    game hacks to process data from tens of millions of hours of in-game data
    and use the results to generate copies of a game's map, monsters, quests,
    items, spells, non-playable characters, and more. We also used a wiki
    crawler to obtain a large amount of data, generate additional code, and
    guide our cheat scripts in what to look for, clarify, and ignore. After
    explaining our end-game vision, I'll dive deep into the architecture of the
    game client, server and protocol. Once that's out of the way, I'll talk
    about the different types of hacks we used, how they work, and what data
    they were able to obtain. Once that's out of the way, I'll round out the
    story by explaining exactly what type of data we gathered and what parts of
    our toolkit we used to gather it.

### Tools

* [Pince](https://github.com/korcankaraokcu/PINCE)

  * PINCE is a gdb front-end/reverse engineering tool focused on games, but it
    can be used for any reverse-engineering related stuff. PINCE is an
    abbreviation for "PINCE is not Cheat Engine". PINCE's GUI is heavily
    "inspired(;D)" by Cheat Engine.
