* [MoRE Shadow Walker : TLB - splitting on Modern x86](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU1uNGZ7HnY)

  * This presentation provides a cohesive overview of the work performed by AIS,
    Inc. on the DARPA CFT MoRE effort. MoRE was a 4-month effort which examined
    the feasibility of utilizing TLB splitting as a mechanism for periodic
    measurement of dynamically changing binaries. The effort created a
    proof-of-concept system to split the TLB for target applications, allowing
    dynamic applications to be measured and can detect code corruption with low
    performance overhead.

* [How Many Million BIOSes Would you Like to Infect?](http://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2015ams/sessions/how-many-million-bioses-would-you-like-to-infect/)

  * This talk is going to be all about how the automation of BIOS vulnerability
    exploitation and leveraging of built-in capabilities can yield highly
    portable UEFI firmware malware. And how millions of systems will be
    vulnerable for years, because no one cares enough to patch the BIOS bugs
    weve found. So you think youre doing OPSEC right, right? Youre going to
    crazy lengths to protect yourself, reinstalling your main OS every month, or
    using a privacy-conscious live DVD like TAILS. Guess what? BIOS malware
    doesnt care! BIOS malware doesnt give a shit

* [Measurement of Running Executables](http://vimeo.com/81335517)

* [From Kernel to VM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSw8Ff1SFLM)

  * [Description from stormeh on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rootkit/comments/25hsc4/jacob_i_torrey_from_kernel_to_vmm/):
    Although it's not directly a lecture about rootkit development, the topics
    discussed are very much of interest: hardware virtualization, page table and
    TLB manipulation, hypervisors and privilege levels below ring 0, etc. The
    speaker does also go on to mention how prior rootkits such as Blue Pill and
    Shadow Walker leveraged these features, as well as defensive technologies
    such as PaX.

  * MoRE, or Measurement of Running Executables, was a DARPA Cyber Fast Track
    effort to study the feasibility of utilizi ng x86 translation look - aside
    buffer (TLB) splitting techniques for realizing periodic measurements of
    running and dynamically changing applications. It built upon PaX, which used
    TLB splitting to emulate the no - execute bit and Shadow Walker, a memory
    hidi ng rootkit ; both designed for earlier processor architectures. MoRE
    and MoRE Shadow Walker are a defensive TLB splitting system and a prototype
    memory hiding rootkit for the current Intel i - series processors
    respectively demonstrating the evolution of th e x86 architecture and how
    its complexity allows software to effect the apparent hardware architecture.

* [Smart TV Security - #1984 in 21 st century](https://cansecwest.com/slides/2013/SmartTV%20Security.pdf)

  * This talk is more about security bugs and rootkits than about firmware for
    TVs. This talk more covers rootkits than security bugs and exploitation
    thereof, as theyre not different to traditional techniques. This talk is
    about general security issues of all Smart TV vendors.

  * The research provided in this paper describes in details how to reverse
    engineer and modify System Management Interrupt (SMI) handlers in the BIOS
    system firmware and how to implement and detect SMM keystroke logger. This
    work also presents proof of concept code of SMM keystroke logger that uses
    I/O Trap based keystroke interception and a code for detection of such
    keystroke logger.

### Papers

* [A Catalog of Windows Local Kernel-mode Backdoors](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=35&t=sumry)

  * This paper presents a detailed catalog of techniques that can be used to
    create local kernel-mode backdoors on Windows. These techniques include
    function trampolines, descriptor table hooks, model-specific register hooks,
    page table modifications, as well as others that have not previously been
    described. The majority of these techniques have been publicly known far in
    advance of this paper. However, at the time of this writing, there appears
    to be no detailed single point of reference for many of them. The intention
    of this paper is to provide a solid understanding on the subject of local
    kernel-mode backdoors. This understanding is necessary in order to encourage
    the thoughtful discussion of potential countermeasures and perceived
    advancements. In the vein of countermeasures, some additional thoughts are
    given to the common misconception that PatchGuard, in its current design,
    can be used to prevent kernel-mode rootkits.

* [Implementation and Implications of a Stealth Hard-Drive Backdoor](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/users/kurmus/papers/acsac13.pdf)

  * Modern workstations and servers implicitly trust hard disks to act as
    well-behaved block devices. This paper analyzes the catastrophic loss of
    security that occurs when hard disks are not trustworthy. First, we show
    that it is possible to compromise the firmware of a commercial
    over-the-shelf hard drive, by resorting only to public information and
    reverse engineering. Using such a compromised firmware, we present a stealth
    rootkit that replaces arbitrary blocks from the disk while they are written,
    providing a data replacement back- door . The measured performance overhead
    of the compromised disk drive is less than 1% compared with a normal,
    non-malicious disk drive. We then demonstrate that a re- mote attacker can
    even establish a communication channel with a compromised disk to infiltrate
    commands and to ex-filtrate data. In our example, this channel is
    established over the Internet to an unmodified web server that relies on the
    compromised drive for its storage, passing through the original webserver,
    database server, database storage engine, filesystem driver, and block
    device driver. Additional experiments, performed in an emulated disk-drive
    environment, could automatically extract sensitive data such as /etc/shadow
    (or a secret key file) in less than a minute. This paper claims that the
    diffculty of implementing such an at- tack is not limited to the area of
    government cyber-warfare; rather, it is well within the reach of moderately
    funded criminals, botnet herders and academic researchers.

* [futo](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=17&t=sumry)

  * Since the introduction of FU, the rootkit world has moved away from
    implementing system hooks to hide their presence. Because of this change in
    offense, a new defense had to be developed. The new algorithms used by
    rootkit detectors, such as BlackLight, attempt to find what the rootkit is
    hiding instead of simply detecting the presence of the rootkit's hooks. This
    paper will discuss an algorithm that is used by both Blacklight and IceSword
    to detect hidden processes. This paper will also document current weaknesses
    in the rootkit detection field and introduce a more complete stealth
    technique implemented as a prototype in FUTo.
