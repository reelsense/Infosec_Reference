* [Shellpaste](https://github.com/andrew-morris/shellpaste)

  * Tiny snippet of code that pulls ASCII shellcode from pastebin and executes
    it. The purpose of this is to have a minimal amount of benign code so AV
    doesn't freak out, then it pulls down the evil stuff. People have been doing
    this kind of stuff for years so I take no credit for the concept. That being
    said, this code (or similar code) works surprisingly often during pentests
    when conventional malware fails.

### General

* [Stegano](https://github.com/cedricbonhomme/Stegano)

  * Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a
    way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the
    existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity.
    Consequently, functions provided by Stéganô only hide messages, without
    encryption. Steganography is often used with cryptography.

* [DotNetToJScript](https://github.com/tyranid/DotNetToJScript)

  * A tool to create a JScript file which loads a .NET v2 assembly from memory.

#### Talks/Videos

* [Chw00t: Breaking Unixes’ Chroot Solutions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A7yJxh-fyc)

#### Tools

* [Linux_Exploit_Suggester](https://github.com/PenturaLabs/Linux_Exploit_Suggester)

  * Linux Exploit Suggester; based on operating system release number. This
    program run without arguments will perform a 'uname -r' to grab the Linux
    Operating Systems release version, and return a suggestive list of possible
    exploits. Nothing fancy, so a patched/back-ported patch may fool this
    script. Additionally possible to provide '-k' flag to manually enter the
    Kernel Version/Operating System Release Version.

* [Basic Linux Privilege Escalation - g0tmi1k](http://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/)

  * Not so much a script as a resource, g0tmi1k’s blog post here has led to so
    many privilege escalations on Linux system’s it’s not funny. Would
    definitely recommend trying out everything on this post for enumerating
    systems.

* [LinEnum](http://www.rebootuser.com/?p=1758)

  * This tool is great at running through a heap of things you should check on a
    Linux system in the post exploit process. This include file permissions,
    cron jobs if visible, weak credentials etc. The first thing I run on a newly
    compromised system.

* [LinuxPrivChecker](http://www.securitysift.com/download/linuxprivchecker.py)

  * This is a great tool for once again checking a lot of standard things like
    file permissions etc. The real gem of this script is the recommended
    privilege escalation exploits given at the conclusion of the script. This is
    a great starting point for escalation.

* [Unix Privilege Escalation Checker](https://code.google.com/p/unix-privesc-check/)

  * Unix-privesc-checker is a script that runs on Unix systems (tested on
    Solaris 9, HPUX 11, Various Linuxes, FreeBSD 6.2). It tries to find
    misconfigurations that could allow local unprivileged users to escalate
    privileges to other users or to access local apps (e.g. databases). It is
    written as a single shell script so it can be easily uploaded and run (as
    opposed to un-tarred, compiled and installed). It can run either as a normal
    user or as root (obviously it does a better job when running as root because
    it can read more files).

* [EvilAbigail](https://github.com/GDSSecurity/EvilAbigail/blob/master/README.md)

  * Initrd encrypted root fs attack

* [Triple-Fetch-Kernel-Creds](https://github.com/coffeebreakerz/Tripple-Fetch-Kernel-Creds)

* [Analyzing local privilege escalations in win32k](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=45&t=sumry)

  * This paper analyzes three vulnerabilities that were found in win32k.sys that
    allow kernel-mode code execution. The win32k.sys driver is a major component
    of the GUI subsystem in the Windows operating system. These vulnerabilities
    have been reported by the author and patched in MS08-025. The first
    vulnerability is a kernel pool overflow with an old communication mechanism
    called the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) protocol. The second vulnerability
    involves improper use of the ProbeForWrite function within string management
    functions. The third vulnerability concerns how win32k handles system menu
    functions. Their discovery and exploitation are covered.

* [The Art of Becoming TrustedInstaller](https://tyranidslair.blogspot.co.uk/2017/08/the-art-of-becoming-trustedinstaller.html)

  * There's many ways of getting the TI token other than these 3 techniques. For
    example as Vincent Yiu pointed out on Twitter if you've got easy access to a
    system token, say using Metasploit's getsystem command you can impersonate
    system and then open the TI token, it's just IMO less easy :-). If you get a
    system token with SeTcbPrivilege you can also call LogonUserExExW or
    LsaLogonUser where you can specify an set of additional groups to apply to a
    service token. Finally if you get a system token with SeCreateTokenPrivilege
    (say from LSASS.exe if it's not running PPL) you can craft an arbitrary
    token using the NtCreateToken system call.

#### Misc Privilege Escalation

* [dtappgather-poc.sh](https://github.com/HackerFantastic/Public/blob/master/exploits/dtappgather-poc.sh)

  * Exploit PoC reverse engineered from EXTREMEPARR which provides local root on
    Solaris 7 - 11 (x86 & SPARC). Uses a environment variable of setuid binary
    dtappgather to manipulate file permissions and create a user owned directory
    anywhere on the system (as root). Can then add a shared object to locale
    folder and run setuid binaries with an untrusted library file.

### Powershell Things

* [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)

  * Empire is a post-exploitation framework that includes a pure-PowerShell2.0
    Windows agent, and a pure Python 2.6/2.7 Linux/OS X agent. It is the merge
    of the previous PowerShell Empire and Python EmPyre projects. The framework
    offers cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. On
    the PowerShell side, Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents
    without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules
    ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade
    network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework.
    PowerShell Empire premiered at BSidesLV in 2015 and Python EmPyre premeiered
    at HackMiami 2016.

* [Koadic](https://github.com/zerosum0x0/koadic)

  * Koadic, or COM Command & Control, is a Windows post-exploitation rootkit
    similar to other penetration testing tools such as Meterpreter and
    Powershell Empire. The major difference is that Koadic does most of its
    operations using Windows Script Host (a.k.a. JScript/VBScript), with
    compatibility in the core to support a default installation of Windows 2000
    with no service packs (and potentially even versions of NT4) all the way
    through Windows 10.

* [Dirty Powershell Webserver](http://obscuresecurity.blogspot.com/2014/05/dirty-powershell-webserver.html)
* [Brosec](https://github.com/gabemarshall/Brosec)

  * Brosec is a terminal based reference utility designed to help us infosec
    bros and broettes with usefuPowershelll (yet sometimes complex) payloads and
    commands that are often used during work as infosec practitioners. An
    example of one of Brosec's most popular use cases is the ability to generate
    on the fly reverse shells (python, perl, powershell, etc) that get copied to
    the clipboard.

* [UnmanagedPowerShell](https://github.com/leechristensen/UnmanagedPowerShell/tree/master)
* [ps1-toolkit](https://github.com/vysec/ps1-toolkit)

  * This is a set of PowerShell scripts that are used by many penetration
    testers released by multiple leading professionals. This is simply a
    collection of scripts that are prepared and obfuscated to reduce level of
    detectability and to slow down incident response from understanding the
    actions performed by an attacker.

### Awareness

* [Veil-PowerView](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil-PowerView)

  * Veil-PowerView is a powershell tool to gain network situational awareness on
    Windows domains. It contains a set of pure-powershell replacements for
    various windows "net \_" commands, which utilize powershell AD hooks and
    underlying Win32 API functions to perform useful Windows domain
    functionality.

* [PowerShell-AD-Recon](https://github.com/PyroTek3/PowerShell-AD-Recon)

  * AD PowerShell Recon Scripts

### Active Directory

* [Find AD users with empty password using PowerShell](https://4sysops.com/archives/find-ad-users-with-empty-password-passwd_notreqd-flag-using-powershell/)
* [LDAPDomainDump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/ldapdomaindump)

  * In an Active Directory domain, a lot of interesting information can be
    retrieved via LDAP by any authenticated user (or machine). This makes LDAP
    an interesting protocol for gathering information in the recon phase of a
    pentest of an internal network. A problem is that data from LDAP often is
    not available in an easy to read format. ldapdomaindump is a tool which aims
    to solve this problem, by collecting and parsing information available via
    LDAP and outputting it in a human readable HTML format, as well as machine
    readable json and csv/tsv/greppable files.

* [ACLight](https://github.com/cyberark/ACLight)

  * The tool queries the Active Directory (AD) for its objects' ACLs and then
    filters and analyzes the sensitive permissions of each one. The result is a
    list of domain privileged accounts in the network (from the advanced ACLs
    perspective of the AD). You can run the scan with just any regular user
    (could be non-privileged user) and it automatically scans all the domains of
    the scanned network forest.

* [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper)

  * MailSniper is a penetration testing tool for searching through email in a
    Microsoft Exchange environment for specific terms (passwords, insider intel,
    network architecture information, etc.). It can be used as a
    non-administrative user to search their own email, or by an Exchange
    administrator to search the mailboxes of every user in a domain. MailSniper
    also includes additional modules for password spraying, enumerating
    users/domains, gathering the Global Address List from OWA and EWS, and
    checking mailbox permissions for every Exchange user at an organization. \_

* [Invoke-TheHash](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash)

  * Invoke-TheHash contains PowerShell functions for performing pass the hash
    WMI and SMB tasks. WMI and SMB services are accessed through .NET TCPClient
    connections. Authentication is performed by passing an NTLM hash into the
    NTLMv2 authentication protocol. Local administrator privilege is not
    required client-side.

  * It is possible to invoke Windows API function calls via internal .NET native
    method wrappers in PowerShell without requiring P/Invoke or C# compilation.
    How is this useful for an attacker? You can call any Windows API function
    (exported or non-exported) entirely in memory. For those familiar with
    Metasploit internals, think of this as an analogue to railgun.

  * Windows APIs are often a blackbox with poor documentation, taking input and
    spewing output with little visibility on what actually happens in the
    background. By reverse engineering (and abusing) some of these seemingly
    benign APIs, we can effectively manipulate Windows into performing stealthy
    custom attacks using previously unknown persistent and injection techniques.
    In this talk, we’ll get Windows to play with itself nonstop while revealing
    0day persistence, previously unknown DLL injection techniques, and Windows
    API tips and tricks. To top it all off, a custom HTTP beaconing backdoor
    will be released leveraging the newly released persistence and injection
    techniques. So much Windows abuse, so little time.

  * Orchestrating BloodHound and Empire for Automated AD Post-Exploitation.
    Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation are two of the main steps in the
    Active Directory attacker kill- chain. Applying the 'assume breach'
    mentality, more and more companies are asking for red-teaming type of
    assessments, and security researcher have therefor developed a wide range of
    open-source tools to assist them during these engagements. Out of these, two
    have quickly gained a solid reputation: PowerShell Empire and BloodHound
    (Both by @Harmj0y & ex-ATD Crew). In this Session, I will be presenting
    DogStrike, a new tool (PowerShell Modules) made to interface Empire &
    BloodHound, allowing penetration testers to merge their Empire
    infrastructure into the bloodhound graph database. Doing so allows the
    operator to request a bloodhound path that is 'Agent Aware', and makes it
    possible to automate the entire kill chain, from initial foothold to DA - or
    any desired part of an attacker's routine. Presentation will be demo-driven.
    Code for the module will be made public after the presentation. Automation
    of Active Directory post-exploitation is going to happen sooner than you
    might think. (Other tools are being released with the same goal*). Is it a
    good thing? Is it a bad thing? If I do not run out of time, I would like to
    finish the presentation by opening the discussion with the audience and see
    what the consequences of automated post- exploitation could mean, from the
    red, the blue or any other point of view... *: DeathStar by @Byt3Bl33d3r |

    Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths
    that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use
    BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and
    red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of
    privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment.

* [You Can Type, but You Can’t Hide: A Stealthy GPU-based Keylogger](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/gpukeylogger.eurosec13.pdf)

  * Keyloggers are a prominent class of malware that harvests sensitive data by
    recording any typed in information. Key- logger implementations strive to
    hide their presence using rootkit-like techniques to evade detection by
    antivirus and other system protections. In this paper, we present a new
    approach for implementing a stealthy keylogger: we explore the possibility
    of leveraging the graphics card as an alterna- tive environment for hosting
    the operation of a keylogger. The key idea behind our approach is to monitor
    the system’s keyboard buffer directly from the GPU via DMA, without any
    hooks or modifications in the kernel’s code and data structures besides the
    page table. The evaluation of our pro- totype implementation shows that a
    GPU-based keylogger can effectively record all user keystrokes, store them
    in the memory space of the GPU, and even analyze the recorded data in-place,
    with negligible runtime overhead.

  * Got root on OSX? Do you want to persist between reboots and have access
    whenever you need it? You do not need plists, new binaries, scripts, or
    other easily noticeable techniques. Kext programming and kernel patching can
    be troublesome! Leverage already running daemon processes to guarantee your
    access. As the presentation will show, if given userland administrative
    access (read: root), how easy it is to persist between reboots without
    plists, non-native binaries, scripting, and kexts or kernel patching using
    the Backdoor Factory.

    failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent
    problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly
    mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket-
    Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately-
    we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

### Avoiding/Bypassing AV(Anti-Virus)/UAC/Whitelisting/Sandboxes/etc

  * The shortcomings of anti-virus (AV) solutions have been well known for some
    time. Nevertheless, both public and private organizations continue to rely
    on AV software as a critical component of their information security
    programs, acting as a key protection mechanism over endpoints and other
    information systems within their networks. As a result, the security posture
    of these organizations is significantly jeopardized by relying only on this
    weakened control.

  * In this article I am going to describe a way to execute code in windows
    kernel by using windbg local kernel debugging. It’s not a vulnerability, I
    am going to use only windbg’s legal functionality, and I am going to use
    only a batch file (not powershell, or vbs, an old style batch only) and some
    Microsoft’s signed executables (some of them that are already in the system
    and windbg, that we will be dumped from the batch file). With this method it
    is not necessary to launch executables at user mode (only Microsoft signed
    executables) or load signed drivers. PatchGuard and other protections don’t
    stop us. We put our code directly into kernel memory space and we hook some
    point to get a thread executing it. As we will demonstrate, a malware
    consisting of a simple batch file would be able to jump to kernel, enabling
    local kernel debugging and using windbg to get its code being executed in
    kernel.

  * Imagine being attacked by legitimate software tools that cannot be detected
    by usual defender tools. How bad could it be to be attacked by malicious
    threat actors only sending bytes to be read and bytes to be written in order
    to achieve advanced attacks? The most dangerous threat is the one you can’t
    see. At a time when it is not obvious to detect memory attacks using API
    like VirtualAlloc, what would be worse than having to detect something like
    “f 0xffffe001`0c79ebe8+0x8 L4 0xe8 0xcb 0x04 0x10”? We will be able to
    demonstrate that we can achieve every kind of attacks you can imagine using
    only PowerShell and a Microsoft Signed Debugger. We can retrieve passwords
    from the userland memory, execute shellcode by dynamically parsing loaded PE
    or attack the kernel achieving advanced persistence inside any system.

  * Description: In this talk we’ll do an architectural decomposition of
    application sandboxing technology from a security perspective. We look at
    various popular sandboxes such as Google Chrome, Adobe ReaderX, Sandboxie
    amongst others and discuss the limitations of each technology and it’s
    implementation. Further, we discuss in depth with live exploits how to break
    out of each category of sandbox by leveraging various kernel and user mode
    exploits – something that future malware could leverage. Some of these
    exploit vectors have not been discussed widely and awareness is important.

  * Kerberos- besides having three heads and guarding the gates of hell-
    protects services on Microsoft Windows Domains. Its use is increasing due to
    the growing number of attacks targeting NTLM authentication. Attacking
    Kerberos to access Windows resources represents the next generation of
    attacks on Windows authentication.In this talk Tim will discuss his research
    on new attacks against Kerberos- including a way to attack the credentials
    of a remote service without sending traffic to the service as well as
    rewriting tickets to access systems.He will also examine potential
    countermeasures against Kerberos attacks with suggestions for mitigating the
    most common weaknesses in Windows Kerberos deployments.

* [Et tu - Kerberos?](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t109-et-tu-kerberos-christopher-campbell)

  * For over a decade we have been told that Kerberos is the answer to
    Microsoft’s authentication woes and now we know that isn’t the case. The
    problems with LM and NTLM are widely known- but the problems with Kerberos
    have only recently surfaced. In this talk we will look back at previous
    failures in order to look forward. We will take a look at what recent
    problems in Kerberos mean to your enterprise and ways you could possibly
    mitigate them. Attacks such as Spoofed-PAC- Pass-the-Hash- Golden Ticket-
    Pass-the-Ticket and Over-Pass-the-Ticket will be explained. Unfortunately-
    we don’t really know what is next – only that what we have now is broken.

    speed and modern application deployment, amid questionable security. Recent
    advancements of the Linux kernel have coalesced for simple yet powerful OS
    virtualisation via Linux Containers, as implemented by LXC, Docker, and
    CoreOS Rkt among others. Recent container focused start-ups such as Docker
    have helped push containers into the limelight. Linux containers offer
    native OS virtualisation, segmented by kernel namespaces, limited through
    process cgroups and restricted through reduced root capabilities, Mandatory
    Access Control and user namespaces. This paper discusses these container
    features, as well as exploring various security mechanisms. Also included is
    an examination of attack surfaces, threats, and related hardening features
    in order to properly evaluate container security. Finally, this paper
    contrasts different container defaults and enumerates strong security
    recommendations to counter deployment weaknesses-- helping support and
    explain methods for building high-security Linux containers. Are Linux
    containers the future or merely a fad or fantasy? This paper attempts to
    answer that question.

  * Adapting Software Fault Isolation to Contemporary CPU ArchitecturesSoftware
    Fault Isolation (SFI) is an effective approach to sandboxing binary code of
    questionable provenance, an interesting use case for native plugins in a Web
    browser. We present software fault isolation schemes for ARM and x86-64 that
    provide control-flow and memory integrity with average performance overhead
    of under 5% on ARM and 7% on x86-64. We believe these are the best known SFI
    implementations for these architectures, with significantly lower overhead
    than previous systems for similar architectures. Our experience suggests
    that these SFI implementations benefit from instruction-level parallelism,
    and have particularly small impact for work- loads that are data
    memory-bound, both properties that tend to reduce the impact of our SFI
    systems for future CPU implementations.
