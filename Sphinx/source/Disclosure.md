### Tools

* [Cryptoshot](https://github.com/DiabloHorn/cryptoshot)

  * This application will make a screenshot of the desktop. If the desktop
    consists of multiple monitors it should still work fine. However it has only
    been tested with a dual monitor setup. The windows project has the added
    functionality of sending the screenshot to a server of your choosing.
