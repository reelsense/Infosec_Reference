### Making Better Passwords

* [Mnemonic Password Formulas](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=33&t=sumry)

  * The current information technology landscape is cluttered with a large
    number of information systems that each have their own individual
    authentication schemes. Even with single sign-on and multi-system
    authentication methods, systems within disparate management domains are
    likely to be utilized by users of various levels of involvement within the
    landscape as a whole. Due to this complexity and the abundance of
    authentication requirements, many users are required to manage numerous
    credentials across various systems. This has given rise to many different
    insecurities relating to the selection and management of passwords. This
    paper details a subset of issues facing users and managers of authentication
    systems involving passwords, discusses current approaches to mitigating
    those issues, and finally introduces a new method for password management
    and recalls termed Mnemonic Password Formulas.

### crack Cracking Passwords/Hashes

* [Introduction to Cracking Hashes](http://n0where.net/introduction-break-that-hash/)

  * Good introduction source to hash cracking.

* [Cracking Active Directory Passwords or How to Cook AD Crack"](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/testing/cracking-active-directory-passwords-how-cook-ad-crack-37940)
* [Cracking Corporate Passwords Exploiting Password Policy Weaknesses - Minga / Rick Redman Derbycon 2013](https://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon3/1301-cracking-corporate-passwords-exploiting-password-policy-weaknesses-minga-rick-redman)

### App Specific Tools(as in single application focus)

* [crackxls2003 0.4](https://github.com/GavinSmith0123/crackxls2003)

  * This program may be used to break the encryption on Microsoft Excel and
    Microsoft Word file which have been encrypted using the RC4 method, which
    uses a 40-bit-long key. This was the default encryption method in Word and
    Excel 97/2000/2002/2003. This program will not work on files encrypted using
    Word or Excel 2007 or later, or for versions 95 or earlier. It will not work
    if a file was encrypted with a non-default method. Additionally, documents
    created with the Windows system locale set to France may use a different
    encryption method.

#### OCL/Hashcat

* [OCL hashcat wiki](http://hashcat.net/wiki/)

* [OCL hashcat](http://n0where.net/introduction-break-that-hash/)

  * Its OCL hashcat

### Hashcat attacks

* [Mask atttack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack)

  * Try all combinations from a given keyspace just like in Brute-Force attack,
    but more specific.

* [Combinator attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=combinator_attack)

  * Each word of a dictionary is appended to each word in a dictionary.

* [Dictionary attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=dictionary_attack)

  * The dictionary attack is a very simple attack mode. It is also known as a
    Wordlist attack.

* [Fingerprint Attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=fingerprint_attack)

  * The Fingerprint attack is a combination of the results of the expander with
    a combination engine. It is an automatically generated attack on pattern
    that works fine on GPGPU.

* [Hybrid attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hybrid_attack)

  * Basically, the hybrid attack is just a Combinator attack. One side is simply
    a dictionary, the other is the result of a Brute-Force attack. In other
    words, the full Brute-Force keyspace is either appended or prepended to each
    of the words from the dictionary. That's why it's called hybrid.

* [Mask attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack)

  * Try all combinations from a given keyspace just like in Brute-Force attack,
    but more specific.

* [Permutation attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=permutation_attack)

  * Each word in a dictionary generates all permutations of itself.

* [Rule Based attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack)

  * The rule-based attack is one of the most complicated of all the attack
    modes. The reason for this is very simple. The rule-based attack is like a
    programming language designed for password candidate generation. It has
    functions to modify, cut or extend words and has conditional operators to
    skip some, etc. That makes it the most flexible, accurate and efficient
    attack.

* [Table Lookup attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=table_lookup_attack)

  * With each word in our dictionary, it automatically generates masks as in a
    batch of Mask attack.

* [Toggle-Case attack](http://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=toggle_case_attack)

  * For each word in a dictionary, all possible combinations of upper- and
    lower-case variants are generated.

### Tools

* [Patator](https://github.com/lanjelot/patator)

  * Patator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack,
    Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks. I
    opted for a different approach in order to not create yet another
    brute-forcing tool and avoid repeating the same shortcomings. Patator is a
    multi-threaded tool written in Python, that strives to be more reliable and
    flexible than his fellow predecessors.

* [Firefox password cracker](https://github.com/pradeep1288/ffpasscracker)
* [Cracklord](https://github.com/jmmcatee/cracklord)

  * CrackLord is a system designed to provide a scalable, pluggable, and
    distributed system for both password cracking as well as any other jobs
    needing lots of computing resources. Better said, CrackLord is a way to load
    balance the resources, such as CPU, GPU, Network, etc. from multiple
    hardware systems into a single queueing service across two primary services:
    the Resource and Queue. It won't make these tasks faster, but it will make
    it easier to manage them.

* [Dagon](https://github.com/Ekultek/Dagon)

  * Named after the prince of Hell, Dagon (day-gone) is an advanced hash
    cracking and manipulation system, capable of bruteforcing multiple hash
    types, creating bruteforce dictionaries, automatic hashing algorithm
    verification, random salt generation from Unicode to ASCII, and much more.

### Wordlist Generation

* [GitDigger](https://github.com/wick2o/gitdigger)

  * gitDigger: Creating realworld wordlists from github hosted data.

* [Wikigen](https://github.com/zombiesam/wikigen)

  * A script to generate wordlists out of wikipedia pages. Should support most
    of the subdomains. Some ugly code may occur

* [CeWL](http://digi.ninja/projects/cewl.php)

  * CeWL is a ruby app which spiders a given url to a specified depth,
    optionally following external links, and returns a list of words which can
    then be used for password crackers such as John the Ripper.

### Papers

* [Optimizing computation of Hash Algorithms as an attacker](https://hashcat.net/events/p13/js-ocohaaaa.pdf)
* [Attacking NTLM with Precomputed Hashtables](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=13&t=sumry)

  * Breaking encrypted passwords has been of interest to hackers for a long
    time, and protecting them has always been one of the biggest security
    problems operating systems have faced, with Microsoft's Windows being no
    exception. Due to errors in the design of the password encryption scheme,
    especially in the LanMan(LM) scheme, Windows has a bad track in this field
    of information security. Especially in the last couple of years, where the
    outdated DES encryption algorithm that LanMan is based on faced more and
    more processing power in the average household, combined with ever
    increasing harddisk size, made it crystal clear that LanMan nowadays is not
    just outdated, but even antiquated.

* [Website Dedicated to Password Research](http://www.passwordresearch.com/papers/pubindex.html)

  * A core objective of the Password Research Institute is to improve the
    industry awareness of existing authentication research. Many valuable
    solutions for the problems associated with authentication have gone
    unnoticed by the people interested in, or responsible for, authentication
    security. This project will compile and share a comprehensive, but
    moderated, index of password and authentication related research papers. We
    aim to share the details of useful papers, provide access to the papers, and
    encourage collaboration between authors and other security professionals.
