# Threat Intelligence (or lack therof)

* [No Budget Threat Intelligence - Tracking Malware Campaigns on the Cheap - ShmooCon15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKfWukYffsE&app=desktop)

  * "In this talk, I'll be discussing my experience developing
    intelligence-gathering capabilities to track several different independent
    groups of threat actors on a very limited budget (read: virtually no budget
    whatsoever). I'll discuss discovering the groups using open source
    intelligence gathering and honeypots, monitoring attacks, collecting and
    analyzing malware artifacts to figure out what their capabilities are, and
    reverse engineering their malware to develop the capability to track their
    targets in real time. Finally, I'll chat about defensive strategies and
    provide recommendations for enterprise security analysts and other security
    researchers. I'll also be releasing a suite of tools I created to help
    threat researchers perform tracking and attribution.

  * "Our Flagship Project, is a cyber threat intelligence management system. CIF
    allows you to combine known malicious threat information from many sources
    and use that information for identification (incident response), detection
    (IDS) and mitigation (null route). The most common types of threat
    intelligence warehoused in CIF are IP addresses, domains and urls that are
    observed to be related to malicious activity."

* [Collaborative Research Into Threats](https://crits.github.io/)

  * CRITs is an open source malware and threat repository that leverages other
    open source software to create a unified tool for analysts and security
    experts engaged in threat defense. It has been in development since 2010
    with one goal in mind: give the security community a flexible and open
    platform for analyzing and collaborating on threat data. In making CRITs
    free and open source, we can provide organizations around the world with the
    capability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape. CRITs can
    be installed locally for a private isolated instance or shared among other
    trusted organizations as a collaborative defense mechanism.
