  * We present an effcient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to
    link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are
    generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging
    scenario when users are behind NATs or rewalls of their ISPs. They allow to
    link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and
    transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a
    natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-o
    by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the Bitcoin network. Our attacks
    require only a few machines and have been experimentally verifed. The
    estimated success rate is between 11% and 60% depending on how stealthy an
    attacker wants to be. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these
    new attacks.
