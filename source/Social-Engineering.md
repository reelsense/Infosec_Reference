  * While several Social Engineering talks and books focus on the techniques no
    one clearly explains why they work. Learn why the techniques are used and
    what impact they have on behavior. Discover aspects of human social
    interaction that can be leveraged to accomplish discrete and specific goals.
    Gain a firm understanding of the limitations of humans objective reasoning.
    Finally understand the social rules that are used to navigate within the
    social engineering construct.

  * This is not a presentation where I talk about how I would get in or the
    things I might be able to do. This is a talk where I am already in and I
    show you pictures from actual engagements that I have been on. They say one
    picture is worth a thousand words I show you how one picture cost a company
    a million dollars and maybe even a few lives. In a community where we focus
    so much on the offensive I also make sure with every attack I highlight. I
    spend time discussing what would have stopped me. We need to know the
    problems but we need more talks providing solutions and that is what I hope
    people will get from this. I show the dangers of Social engineering and how
    even an employee with no SE experience can be an eBay James Bond which can
    cause total financial ruin to a company. These Security threats are real. So
    are these stories!

  * It seems that every day there's a new NextGen firewall, whitelisting and
    blacklisting, DLP, or the latest technology thats suppose to stop us. But
    does it really stop "hackers"? Truth is, naw not really. In this talk we'll
    be showing off the latest bypass techniques for the "latest" hacker
    stoppers, using a universally whitelisted website as our middle man for a
    command and control, social engineering our way into some of the toughest
    companies, and showing off some techniques that work for us. This talk is
    about throwing misconceptions of protection and safety out the window, and
    going back the dirty south. Where thinking outside of the box is a
    requirement. We'll be releasing two new tools, one that makes meterpreter
    invisible over the network, and the other a shell that uses a popular third
    party as the command and control. A vulnerability scanner won't help you
    herrrrrrre.

  * Social engineering is hitting the headlines more than ever. As computer
    security becomes more sophisticated, hackers are combining their technical
    expertise with social engineering to gain access to IT infrastructures and
    critical information. In any security programme people are the weakest link.
    It can often be easier and quicker to target the end user than using
    technical hacking techniques. When you combine both social engineering and
    traditional hacking techniques, you have an extremely dangerous attack. So
    what's next on the social engineering agenda? What are the emerging trends
    and what social engineering techniques might we expect to see in the future?
    In this talk, I will give an overview of the types of social engineering
    attacks people have used throughout the ages, from tricks used by the
    classic conmen of the past to the phishing attacks that are at an all time
    high, and the proliferation of social networking and how useful this is to
    social engineers. I will describe some of the new social engineering
    techniques and trends that are emerging and discuss war stories from my
    experience of social engineering, describing techniques I have used to gain
    access to sensitive information

* [Patching the Human Vulns - Leonard Isham](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon4/t300-patching-the-human-vulns-leonard-isham)

  * You are a hacker, you learn, you play, and you break. The very nature of a
    hacker is to question what is given to us and to play with the rules.
    However, most of us do not apply this methodology in all parts of our lives.
    Many take what is given to us about mood and health as fact and what are the
    results...overweight, depression, anxiety, and self esteem issues. In this
    presentation, we will show 2 hackers and their journey on how they addressed
    the issues mentioned above. Len and Moey followed two separate paths to
    losing over a combined 150 lbs, gaining confidence, and changing their
    outlook. The talk will not only cover the touchy feely portion of how to
    deal with weight, mood,and self esteem but will also be supported by the
    science behind diets, supplements and perspective. The talk will provide
    what worked for two hackers. YMMV.

* [Cheat Codez: Level UP Your SE Game - Eric Smith (@InfoSecMafia)](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/derbycon3/1206-cheat-codez-level-up-your-se-game-eric-smith)

  * Everyone knows what phishing is. Everyone realizes Java applets lead to
    massive storms of shells. Everyone accepts tailgating is the easiest way
    into your building. Everyone knows smoking (areas) are bad for you AND your
    business. Admit it, you paid for that EXACT assessment last year. I could
    write your report for you without even doing the job. So whatâs the problem
    you ask? Thatâs EXACTLY the problem, I say. So how do we fix these issues
    that plague our industry and misalign business expectations? This talk will
    discuss the value of Social Engineering exercises when conducted with
    realistic goals yielding actionable results. Of course, that means putting
    in REAL work throughout the engagement, not âpoint, click, report, rinse and
    repeatâ. Weâll discuss tips, techniques and secrets that the PROS donât
    always blog about. _PRO TIP_ â This wonât be a talk on how to use a
    particular framework or release of a tool (there are plenty of those
    already). So bring your work boots, itâs time to get dirty and UP your game.

* ["Humans, right?" Soft Skills in Security - Ariel Robinson](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnova2017/200-humans-right-soft-skills-in-security-ariel-robinson)

  * Let's face it: humans ruin everything. They are almost always the weak link
    in the information security chain, between their susceptibility to social
    engineering, rejection of security threats, and sheer laziness. You can make
    the best security tool in the business, but if a human doesn't use it right,
    well, you might as well leave your passwords on a sticky note on your-- wait
    a minute. Yes, humans suck at information security. But we don't make it
    easy. Infosec is incredibly inaccessible to your average user. Just ask me:
    I am one. We can't change humans (or get rid of them, no matter how much we
    might want to), but we can change information security. We can leverage
    insights from non-technical disciplines such as cognitive science,
    human-centered design, strategic communications, and psychology. Or we can
    keep hitting our heads against our desktops. As a professional communicator
    and bridge builder, help me help you. To make security work, we have to make
    it easy. For humans.

  *    Sidewalk Sleeper
* Transform into another person:
 *     Can take minutes/hours
   *   Examine each physical attribute
* Some modified easier than others
  *    Entire appearance makes the difference. One part is off, whole cover can be blown
* If using hardhat, make sure to beat the shit out of it. Add stickers.

### Research Papers

* [Construal-Level Theory of Psychological Distance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3152826/)

  * Abstract: People are capable of thinking about the future, the past, remote
    locations, another personâs perspective, and counterfactual alternatives.
    Without denying the uniqueness of each process, it is proposed that they
    constitute different forms of traversing psychological distance.
    Psychological distance is egocentric: Its reference point is the self in the
    here and now, and the different ways in which an object might be removed
    from that pointâin time, in space, in social distance, and in
    hypotheticalityâconstitute different distance dimensions. Transcending the
    self in the here and now entails mental construal, and the farther removed
    an object is from direct experience, the higher (more abstract) the level of
    construal of that object. Supporting this analysis, research shows (a) that
    the various distances are cognitively related to each other, (b) that they
    similarly influence and are influenced by level of mental construal, and (c)
    that they similarly affect prediction, preference, and action.
