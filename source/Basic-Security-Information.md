## Basic Security Principles/Information

### Basic Information

These are links to basic technically links or things I feel might help someone
new to the field.

* [Infosec Tools of the Trade: Getting Your Hands Dirty](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/bsidesnashville2017/bsides-nashville-2017-green00-infosec-tools-of-the-trade-getting-your-hands-dirty-jason-smith-and-tara-wink)

  * In this presentation we'll will be going over introductions to the various
    focuses in information security and demoing the most common tools that are
    used in operational security, both offense and defense. You'll leave with an
    idea on how to freely obtain and use these tools so that you can have what
    you need for that first interview: experience and a passion for security.
    This is a green talk for people who don't have a clue on what offensive and
    defensive people do operationally, from a tool perspective.

* [So you think you want to be a penetration tester - Defcon24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7bvZkgFmY)

  * So, you think you want to be a penetration tester, or you already are and
    don't understand what the difference between you and all the other "so
    called" penetration testers out there. Think you know the difference between
    a Red Team, Penetration Test and a Vulnerability assessment? Know how to
    write a report your clients will actually read and understand? Can you
    leverage the strengths of your team mates to get through tough roadblocks,
    migrate, pivot, pwn and pillage? No? well this talk is probably for you
    then! We will go through the fascinating, intense and often crazily boring
    on-site assessment process. Talk about planning and performing Red Teams,
    how they are different, and why they can be super effective and have some
    fun along the way. I'll tell you stories that will melt your face, brain and
    everything in between. Give you the answers to all of your questions you
    never knew you had, and probably make you question your life choices. By the
    end of this session you will be ready to take your next steps into the job
    you've always wanted, or know deep inside that you should probably look for
    something else. There will be no judgment or shame, only information,
    laughter and fun.
