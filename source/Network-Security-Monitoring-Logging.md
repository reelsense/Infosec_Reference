* [Logging ALL THE THINGS Without All The Cost With Open Source Big Data Tools - DEFCON22 - Zach Fasel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AAnVeIwXBo)

  * Many struggle in their job with the decision of what events to log in battle
    against costly increases to their licensing of a commercial SIEM or other
    logging solution. Leveraging the open source solutions used for "big-data"
    that have been proven by many can help build a scalable, reliable, and
    hackable event logging and security intelligence system to address security
    and (_cringe_) compliance requirements. Weâ€™ll walk through the various
    components and simple steps to building your own logging environment that
    can extensively grow (or keep sized just right) with just additional
    hardware cost and show numerous examples you can implement as soon as you
    get back to work (or home).

* [Passive IPS Reconnaissance and Enumeration - false positive (ab)use - Arron Finnon](https://vimeo.com/108775823)

  * Network Intrusion Prevention Systems or NIPS have been plagued by "False
    Positive" issues almost since their first deployment. A "False Positive"
    could simply be described as incorrectly or mistakenly detecting a threat
    that is not real. A large amount of research has gone into using "False
    Positive" as an attack vector either to attack the very validity of an IPS
    system or to conduct forms of Denial of Service attacks. However the very
    reaction to a "False Positive" in the first place may very well reveal more
    detailed information about defences than you might well think.

* [Shellcode Analysis Pipeline](https://7h3ram.github.io/2014/3/18/shellcode-pipeline/)

  * I recently required an automated way of analyzing shellcode and verifying if
    it is detected by Libemu, Snort, Suricata, Bro, etc. Shellcode had to come
    from public sources like Shell-Storm, Exploit-DB and Metasploit. I needed an
    automated way of sourcing shellcode from these projects and pass it on to
    the analysis engines in a pipeline-like mechanism. This posts documents the
    method I used to complete this task and the overall progress of the project.

* [Elasticsearch: The Definitive Guide The Definitive Guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index.html)
* [LogStash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash)

  * Logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect
    logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). If you
    store them in Elasticsearch, you can view and analyze them with Kibana. It
    is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you
    are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

* [logstash anonymize](http://logstash.net/docs/1.4.2/filters/anonymize)

  * Anonymize fields using by replacing values with a consistent hash.

* [Kibana](https://github.com/elasticsearch/kibana)

  * Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser based analytics and
    search dashboard for Elasticsearch. Kibana is a snap to setup and start
    using. Kibana strives to be easy to get started with, while also being
    flexible and powerful, just like Elasticsearch.

### Making Sense of the Data

* [411](https://github.com/kiwiz/411)

  * Configure Searches to periodically run against a variety of data sources.
    You can define a custom pipeline of Filters to manipulate any generated
    Alerts and forward them to multiple Targets.

* [PCAPDB](https://github.com/dirtbags/pcapdb)

  * PcapDB is a distributed, search-optimized open source packet capture system.
    It was designed to replace expensive, commercial appliances with
    off-the-shelf hardware and a free, easy to manage software system. Captured
    packets are reorganized during capture by flow (an indefinite length
    sequence of packets with the same src/dst ips/ports and transport proto),
    indexed by flow, and searched (again) by flow. The indexes for the captured
    packets are relatively tiny (typically less than 1% the size of the captured
    data).

  * The SiLK analysis suite is a collection of command-line tools for processing
    SiLK Flow records created by the SiLK packing system. These tools read
    binary files containing SiLK Flow records and partition, sort, and count
    these records. The most important analysis tool is rwfilter, an application
    for querying the central data repository for SiLK Flow records that satisfy
    a set of filtering options. The tools are intended to be combined in various
    ways to perform an analysis task. A typical analysis uses UNIX pipes and
    intermediate data files to share data between invocations of the tools.

    systems, sessions, hostnames, open ports etc. without putting any traffic on
    the network. NetworkMiner can also parse PCAP files for off-line analysis
    and to regenerate/reassemble transmitted files and certificates from PCAP
    files.

### Papers

* [Network Profiling Using Flow](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/technicalreport/2012_005_001_28167.pdf)

  * This report provides a step-by-step guide for profilingâ€”discovering
    public-facing assets on a networkâ€”using network flow (netflow) data. Netflow
    data can be used for forensic purposes, for finding malicious activity, and
    for determining appropriate prioritization settings. The goal of this report
    is to create a profile to see a potential attackerâ€™s view of an external
    network. Readers will learn how to choose a data set, find the top assets
    and services with the most traffic on the network, and profile several
    services. A cas e study provides an example of the profiling process. The
    underlying concepts of using netflow data are presented so that readers can
    apply the approach to other cases. A reader using this repor t to profile a
    network can expect to end with a list of public-facing assets and the ports
    on which each is communicating and may also learn other pertinent
    information, such as external IP addresses, to which the asset is
    connecting. This report also provides ideas for using, maintaining, and
    reporting on findings. The appendices include an example profile and scripts
    for running the commands in the report. The scripts are a summary only and
    cannot replace reading and understanding this report.
