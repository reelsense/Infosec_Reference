* [Taming Mr Hayes: Mitigating Signaling Based Attacks on Smartphones](https://www.mulliner.org/collin/academic/publications/mrhayes_mulliner_dsn2012.pdf)

  * Malicious injection of cellular signaling traffic from mobile phones is an
    emerging security issue. The respective attacks can be performed by hijacked
    smartphones and by malware resident on mobile phones. Until today there are
    no protection mechanisms in place to prevent signaling based attacks other
    than implementing expensive additions to the cellular core network. In this
    work we present a protection system that resides on the mobile phone. Our
    solution works by partitioning the phone software stack into the application
    operating system and the communication partition. The application system is
    a standard fully featured Android sys tem. On the other side, communication
    to the cellular network is mediated by a flexible monitoring and enforcement
    system running on the communication partition. We implemented and evaluated
    our protection system on a real smartphone. Our evaluation shows that it can
    mitigate all currently know n signaling based attacks and in addition can
    protect users fr om cellular Trojans. _ Cellular Networks in Use: _ In use

#### APCO Project 25 (P25)

* [HOPE Number Nine (2012): Practical Insecurity in Encrypted Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7or-_gT8TWU&app=desktop)

  * APCO Project 25 ("P25") is a suite of wireless communications protocols used
    in the United States and elsewhere for public safety two-way (voice) radio
    systems. The protocols include security options in which voice and data
    traffic can be cryptographically protected from eavesdropping. This talk
    analyzes the security of P25 systems against passive and active adversaries.
    The panel found a number of protocol, implementation, and user interface
    weaknesses that routinely leak information to a passive eavesdropper or that
    permit highly efficient and difficult to detect active attacks. They found
    new "selective subframe jamming" attacks against P25, in which an active
    attacker with very modest resources can prevent specific kinds of traffic
    (such as encrypted messages) from being received, while emitting only a
    small fraction of the aggregate power of the legitimate transmitter. And,
    more significantly, they found that even passive attacks represent a serious
    immediate threat. In an over-the-air analysis conducted over a two year
    period in several U.S. metropolitan areas, they found that a significant
    fraction of the "encrypted" P25 tactical radio traffic sent by federal law
    enforcement surveillance operatives is actually sent in the clear - in spite
    of their users' belief that they are encrypted - and often reveals such
    sensitive data as the names of informants in criminal investigations.

    protection ideas becoming commercially available. Networks, therefore, have
    to improve continuously to maintain their score, just as hackers are
    continuously improving their capabilities.

  * The worlds most popular radio system has over 3 billion handsets in 212
    countries and not even strong encryption. Perhaps due to cold-war era laws,
    GSM's security hasn't received the scrutiny it deserves given its
    popularity. This bothered us enough to take a look; the results were
    surprising. From the total lack of network to handset authentication, to the
    "Of course I'll give you my IMSI" message, to the iPhone that really wanted
    to talk to us. It all came as a surprise  stunning to see what $1500 of USRP
    can do. Add a weak cipher trivially breakable after a few months of
    distributed table generation and you get the most widely deployed privacy
    threat on the planet. Cloning, spoofing, man-in-the-middle, decrypting,
    sniffing, crashing, DoS'ing, or just plain having fun. If you can work a
    BitTorrent client and a standard GNU build process then you can do it all,
    too. Prepare to change the way you look at your cell phone, forever

* [Wideband GSM Sniffing [27C3]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrbatnnRxFc)

  * GSM is still the most widely used security technology in the world with a
    user base of 5 billion and a quickly growing number of critical
    applications. 26C3's rainbow table attack on GSM's A5/1 encryption convinced
    many users that GSM calls should be considered unprotected. The network
    operators, however, have not woken up to the threat yet. Perhaps the new
    capabilities to be unleashed this year -- like wide-band sniffing and
    real-time signal processing -- will wake them up. Now that GSM A5/1
    encryption can be cracked in seconds, the complexity of wireless phone
    snooping moved to signal processing. Since GSM hops over a multitude of
    channels, a large chunk of radio spectrum needs to be analyzed, for example
    with USRPs, and decoded before storage or decoding. We demonstrate how this
    high bandwidth task can be achieved with cheap programmable phones.

* [29C3 GSM: Cell phone network review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wwco24EsHs)

  * Did you notice 262 42 in your mobile phone network search list at the last
    CCC events? Did you and your friends buy SIM cards at the PoC and help test
    the network by calling each other, or by calling through the bridge to the
    DECT network services? Did you ever wonder about the details of this open
    source test network, set up by a team of volunteers in the middle of the
    city? We would like to tell you all the details of the cell phone network we
    operate at 29C3, and show you some fancy graphs based on the network
    activity! We will describe the process of setting up the test network we
    operate at 29C3, what legal and technical challenges we have faced, and we
    will describe the actual installation at the CCH. We will also compare this
    with the 262 42 test networks that were operated using the same open source
    software but otherwise very different installations at CCC Camp 2011 and
    28C3. We will go on to show various statistics that we collect from the
    network while it has been running.

    out-of-tree projects, which means that PyBOMBS needs to have new recipes for
    any new project. We have done a lot of the initial work to get known
    projects into the PyBOMBS system as is, but we will need project developers
    for new OOT projects or other projects not currently listed to help us out
    with this effort.

* [iSniff](https://github.com/hubert3/iSniff-GPS)

  * iSniff GPS passively sniffs for SSID probes, ARPs and MDNS (Bonjour) packets
    broadcast by nearby iPhones, iPads and other wireless devices. The aim is to
    collect data which can be used to identify each device and determine
    previous geographical locations, based solely on information each device
    discloses about previously joined WiFi networks.
  * iOS devices transmit ARPs which sometimes contain MAC addresses (BSSIDs) of
    previously joined WiFi networks, as described in [1]. iSniff GPS captures
    these ARPs and submits MAC addresses to Apple's WiFi location service
    (masquerading as an iOS device) to obtain GPS coordinates for a given BSSID.
    If only SSID probes have been captured for a particular device, iSniff GPS
    can query network names on wigle.net and visualise possible locations.

  * This paper describes the process of identifying and exploiting 802.11
    wireless device driver vulnerabilities on Windows. This process is described
    in terms of two steps: pre-exploitation and exploitation. The
    pre-exploitation step provides a basic introduction to the 802.11 protocol
    along with a description of the tools and libraries the authors used to
    create a basic 802.11 protocol fuzzer. The exploitation step describes the
    common elements of an 802.11 wireless device driver exploit. These elements
    include things like the underlying payload architecture that is used when
    executing arbitrary code in kernel-mode on Windows, how this payload
    architecture has been integrated into the 3.0 version of the Metasploit
    Framework, and the interface that the Metasploit Framework exposes to make
    developing 802.11 wireless device driver exploits easy. Finally, three
    separate real world wireless device driver vulnerabilities are used as case
    studies to illustrate the application of this process. It is hoped that the
    description and illustration of this process can be used to show that
    kernel-mode vulnerabilities can be just as dangerous and just as easy to
    exploit as user-mode vulnerabilities. In so doing, awareness of the need for
    more robust kernel-mode exploit prevention technology can be raised.

    chipset and device driver an 802.11 device is using. The technique outlined
    is entirely passive, and given the amount of features that are being
    considered for inclusion into the 802.11 standard, seems quite likely that
    it will increase in precision as the standard marches forward. The
    implications of this are far ranging. On one hand, the techniques can be
    used to implement innovative new features in Wireless Intrusion Detection
    Systems (WIDS). On the other, they can be used to target link layer device
    driver attacks with much higher precision.

  * Wifi probes have provided giggles via Karma and Wifi Pineapples for years,
    but is there more fun to be had? Like going from sitting next to someone on
    a bus, to knowing where they live and hang out? Why try to MITM someone’s
    wireless device in an enterprise environment where they may notice — when
    getting them at their favorite burger joint is much easier. In this talk we
    will review ways of collecting and analyzing probes. We’ll use the resulting
    data to figure out where people live, their daily habits, and discuss uses
    (some nice, some not so nice) for this information. We’ll also dicuss how to
    make yourself a little less easy to track using these methods. Stingrays are
    price prohibitive, but for just tracking people’s movements.. this is cheap
    and easy.

  * There are plenty of ways to leverage known wireless attacks against our
    chosen victims. We've discovered a new WiFi discovery methodology that can
    give us insight into attack paths, internal distribution methods, internal
    policies and procedures as well as an opportunity to launch wireless attacks
    deep inside a facility without even stepping inside; no physical penetration
    test needed. How do we make that happen? Box it, tape it and slap an address
    on it: WARSHIPPING. Thanks FedEx, UPS and USPS for doing the heavy lifting
    for us. We've even got a new tool to do some of the heavy lifting for
    location lookups too!

### RFID - Radio Frequency Identification

#### Security of RFID Protocols A Case Study

In the context of Dolev-Yao style analysis of security proto cols, we
investigate the security claims of a pro- posed strong-security RFID
authentication protocol. We ex hibit a flaw which has gone unnoticed in RFID
protocol literature and present the resulting attacks on au thentication,
untraceability, and desynchroniza- tion resistance. We analyze and discuss the
authors proofs of security. References to other vulnerable protocols are given.

  * Hardware and software to run a RFID reader to harvest card information. This
    is the PCB design and Arduino code that will run a RFID reader, allowing you
    to gather and harvest cards. Typically, a larger reader, such as those in
    garages, will be more successful, allowing you to ready over a couple feet
    instead of inches. The board itself is designed to be modular and support
    multiple methods to output harvested cards once they are read:
  * Text file on a MicroSD card
  * Print out to LCD
  * Bluetooth Low Energy Arduino serial connection
  * Each of these options are supported in code, but can be ignored on the PCB.
    The PCB itself has been designed to use a pluggable module for each of these
    options, making it easy to ignore, install, or change out which ones you
    find useful.

  * Z-Wave is a proprietary wireless protocol that is gaining market share in
    home automation and security systems. However, very little work has been
    done to investigate the security implications of these sub-GHz devices. In
    this talk we review recent work on hacking Z-Wave networks, and introduce a
    new attack that creates a persistent back door. This attack maintains a
    stealthy, parallel, and persistent control channel with all Z-Wave devices
    in the home. We will demonstrate the attack against a commercial Z-Wave
    security system.
