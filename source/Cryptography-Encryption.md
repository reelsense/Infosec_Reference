* [Hunting For Vulnerabilities In Signal - Markus Vervier - HITB 2017 AMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n9HmllVftA)

  * Signal is the most trusted secure messaging and secure voice application,
    recommended by Edward Snowden and the Grugq. And indeed Signal uses strong
    cryptography, relies on a solid system architecture, and you’ve never heard
    of any vulnerability in its code base. That’s what this talk is about:
    hunting for vulnerabilities in Signal. We will present vulnerabilities found
    in the Signal Android client, in the underlying Java libsignal library, and
    in example usage of the C libsignal library. Our demos will show how these
    can be used to crash Signal remotely, to bypass the MAC authentication for
    certain attached files, and to trigger memory corruption bugs. Combined with
    vulnerabilities in the Android system it is even possible to remotely brick
    certain Android devices. We will demonstrate how to initiate a permanent
    boot loop via a single Signal message. We will also describe the general
    architecture of Signal, its attack surface, the tools you can use to analyze
    it, and the general threat model for secure mobile communication apps.

### Papers

* [Get Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff/)

  * We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software
    implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our attacks
    use novel side channels and are based on the observation that the "ground"
    electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a computation-dependent
    way. An attacker can measure this signal by touching exposed metal on the
    computer's chassis with a plain wire, or even with a bare hand. The signal
    can also be measured at the remote end of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables.
    Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have extracted
    4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via each of these
    channels, as well as via power analysis and electromagnetic probing. Despite
    the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops and numerous noise sources, the full
    attacks require a few seconds of measurements using Medium Frequency signals
    (around 2 MHz), or one hour using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz).

* [Why does cryptographic software fail? A case study and open problems](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/cryptobugs:apsys14.pdf)

  * Abstract: Mistakes in cryptographic software implementations often undermine
    the strong security guarantees offered by cryptography. This paper presents
    a systematic study of cryptographic vulnerabilities in practice, an
    examination of state-of-the-art techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities,
    and a discussion of open problems and possible future research directions.
    Our study covers 269 cryptographic vulnerabilities reported in the CVE
    database from January 2011 to May 2014. The results show that just 17% of
    the bugs are in cryptographic libraries (which often have devastating
    consequences), and the remaining 83% are misuses of cryptographic libraries
    by individual applications. We observe that preventing bugs in different
    parts of a system requires different techniques, and that no effective
    techniques exist to deal with certain classes of mistakes, such as weak key
    generation.

* [RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis](http://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/)

  * Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
    applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract
    full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models),
    within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the
    decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that
    such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed
    next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.

* [Toward Robust Hidden Volumes Using Write-Only Oblivious RAM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/344.pdf)

  * With sensitive data being increasingly stored on mobile devices and laptops,
    hard disk encryption is more important than ever. In partic- ular, being
    able to plausibly deny that a hard disk contains certain information is a
    very useful and interesting research goal. However, it has been known for
    some time that existing “hidden volume” so- lutions, like TrueCrypt, fail in
    the face of an adversary who is able to observe the contents of a disk on
    multiple, separate occasions. In this work, we explore more robust
    constructions for hidden vol- umes and present HIVE, which is resistant to
    more powerful ad- versaries with multiple-snapshot capabilities. In pursuit
    of this, we propose the first security definitions for hidden volumes, and
    prove HIVE secure under these definitions. At the core of HIVE, we de- sign
    a new write-only Oblivious RAM. We show that, when only hiding writes, it is
    possible to achieve ORAM with optimal O (1) communication complexity and
    only poly-logarithmic user mem- ory. This is a significant improvement over
    existing work and an independently interesting result. We go on to show that
    our write- only ORAM is specially equipped to provide hidden volume func-
    tionality with low overhead and significantly increased security. Fi- nally,
    we implement HIVE as a Linux kernel block device to show both its
    practicality and usefulness on existing platforms.

* [A Messy State of the Union: Taming the Composite State Machines of TLS](https://www.smacktls.com/smack.pdf)

  * Abstract — Implementations of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol
    must handle a variety of protocol versions and extensions, authentication
    modes and key exchange methods, where each combination may prescribe a
    different message sequence between the client and the server. We address the
    problem of designing a robust composite state machine that can correctly
    multiplex between these different protocol modes. We systematically test
    popular open-source TLS implementations for state machine bugs and discover
    several critical security vulnerabilities that have lain hidden in these
    libraries for years (they are now in the process of being patched). We argue
    that these vulnerabilities stem from incorrect compositions of individually
    correct state machines. We present the first verified implementation of a
    composite TLS state machine in C that can be embedded into OpenSSL and
    accounts for all its supported ciphersuites. Our attacks expose the need for
    the formal verifica- tion of core components in cryptographic protocol
    libraries; our implementation demonstrates that such mechanized proofs are
    within reach, even for mainstream TLS implementations.

* [Indistinguishability Obfuscation from the Multilinear Subgroup Elimination Assumption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/309)

  * Abstract: We revisit the question of constructing secure general-purpose
    indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), with a security reduction based on
    explicit computational assumptions over multi- linear maps. Previous to our
    work, such reductions were only known to exist based on meta- assumptions
    and/or ad-hoc assumptions: In the original constructive work of Garg et al.
    (FOCS 2013), the underlying explicit computational assumption encapsulated
    an exponential family of assumptions for each pair of circuits to be
    obfuscated. In the more recent work of Pass et al. (Crypto 2014), the
    underlying assumption is a meta-assumption that also encapsulates an
    exponential family of assumptions, and this meta-assumption is invoked in a
    manner that captures the specific pair of circuits to be obfuscated. The
    assumptions underlying both these works substantially capture (either
    explicitly or implicitly) the actual structure of the obfuscation mechanism
    itself. In our work, we provide the first construction of general-purpose
    indistinguishability obfuscation proven secure via a reduction to a natural
    computational assumption over multilinear maps, namely, the Multilinear
    Subgroup Elimination Assumption. This assumption does not depend on the
    circuits to be obfuscated (except for its size), and does not correspond to
    the underlying structure of our obfuscator. The technical heart of our paper
    is our reduction, which gives a new way to argue about the security of
    indistinguishability obfuscation.

  * Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
    applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can extract
    full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models),
    within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the
    decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally demonstrate that
    such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain mobile phone placed
    next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.

* [The SIGMA Family of Key-Exchange Protocols ]()

  * Summary: SIGMA is a family of cryptographic key-exchange protocols that
    provide perfect forward secrecy via a Diffie-Hellman exchange authenticated
    with digital signatures. SIGMA is designed to support a variety of features
    and trade-offs required in common practical scenarios (such as identity
    protection and reduced number of protocol rounds) as well as to enjoy sound
    cryptographic security. This design puts forth the "SIGn-and-MAc" (SIGMA,
    for short) approach that carefully combines the use of digital signatures
    and MAC functions to guarantee an authenticated binding between the
    Diffie-Hellman key and the identities of the parties to the exchange. This
    simple approach resolves security shortcomings found in previous protocols.
    The SIGMA protocols serve as the cryptographic basis for the signature-based
    modes of the standardized Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, and its
    current revision IKE version 2.

### Software

* [CONIKS](https://coniks.cs.princeton.edu/)

  * CONIKS is a key management system for end users capable of integration in
    end-to-end secure communication services. The main idea is that users should
    not have to worry about managing encryption keys when they want to
    communicate securely, but they also should not have to trust their secure
    communication service providers to act in their interest.

* [The Noise Protocol Framework](http://noiseprotocol.org/noise.html)

  * Noise is a framework for crypto protocols based on Diffie-Hellman key
    agreement. Noise can describe protocols that consist of a single message as
    well as interactive protocols.

  * A Noise protocol begins with two parties exchanging handshake messages.
    During this handshake phase the parties exchange DH public keys and perform
    a sequence of DH operations, hashing the DH results into a shared secret
    key. After the handshake phase each party can use this shared key to send
    encrypted transport messages.

* [Real-time Steganography with RTP](http://uninformed.org/?v=all&a=36&t=sumry)

  * Real-time Transfer Protocol (RTP) is used by nearly all Voice-over-IP
    systems to provide the audio channel for calls. As such, it provides ample
    opportunity for the creation of a covert communication channel due to its
    very nature. While use of steganographic techniques with various audio
    cover-medium has been extensively researched, most applications of such have
    been limited to audio cover-medium of a static nature such as WAV or MP3
    file audio data. This paper details a common technique for the use of
    steganography with audio data cover-medium, outlines the problem issues that
    arise when attempting to use such techniques to establish a full-duplex
    communications channel within audio data transmitted via an unreliable
    streaming protocol, and documents solutions to these problems. An
    implementation of the ideas discussed entitled SteganRTP is included in the
    reference materials.
