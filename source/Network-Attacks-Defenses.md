    respond using the Kerberos error code KRB5KDC_ERR_C_PRINCIPAL_UNKNOWN,
    allowing us to determine that the user name was invalid. Valid user names
    will illicit either the TGT in a AS-REP response or the error
    KRB5KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED, signaling that the user is required to perform
    pre authentication.

- [Sparty - MS Sharepoint and Frontpage Auditing Tool](http://sparty.secniche.org/)

  * Sparty is an open source tool written in python to audit web applications
    using sharepoint and frontpage architecture. The motivation behind this tool
    is to provide an easy and robust way to scrutinize the security
    configurations of sharepoint and frontpage based web applications. Due to
    the complex nature of these web administration software, it is required to
    have a simple and efficient tool that gathers information, check access
    permissions, dump critical information from default files and perform
    automated exploitation if security risks are identified. A number of
    automated scanners fall short of this and Sparty is a solution to that.

- [SPScan](http://sourceforge.net/projects/spscan/)

  * SPScan is a tool written in Ruby that enumerates a SharePoint installation
    gathering information about the version and installed plugins.

- [SPartan](https://github.com/sensepost/SPartan)

    as a much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat. It uses both
    TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool
    to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users.
    Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a
    virtually limitless number of potential uses.

* [RANCID - Really Awesome New Cisco confIg Differ](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/)

  * RANCID monitors a router's (or more generally a device's) configuration,
    including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, etc) and uses CVS
    (Concurrent Version System) or Subversion to maintain history of changes.
    RANCID does this by the very simple process summarized as: login to each
    device in the router table (router.db), run various commands to get the
    information that will be saved, cook the output; re-format, remove
    oscillating or incrementing data, email any differences (sample) from the
    previous collection to a mail list, and finally commit those changes to the
    revision control system

* [Intrusion detection evasion: How Attackers get past the burglar alarm](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/intrusion-detection-evasion-attackers-burglar-alarm-1284)

  * The purpose of this paper is to show methods that attackers can use to fool
    IDS systems into thinking their attack is legitimate traffic. With
    techniques like obfuscation, fragmentation, Denial of Service, and
    application hijacking the attacker can pass traffic under the nose of an IDS
    to prevent their detection. These are techniques that the next generation of
    IDS needs to be able to account for and prevent. Since it would be almost
    impossible to create a product that was not vulnerable to one of these
    deceptions.

* [Beating the IPS](http://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/intrusion/beating-ips-34137)

  * This paper introduces various Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) evasion
    techniques and shows how they can be used to successfully evade detection by
    widely used products from major security vendors. By manipulating the
    header, payload, and traffic flow of a well-known attack, it is possible to
    trick the IPS inspection engines into passing the traffic - allowing the
    attacker shell access to the target system protected by the IPS.

  * Network Intrusion Prevention Systems or NIPS have been plagued by "False
    Positive" issues almost since their first deployment. A "False Positive"
    could simply be described as incorrectly or mistakenly detecting a threat
    that is not real. A large amount of research has gone into using "False
    Positive" as an attack vector either to attack the very validity of an IPS
    system or to conduct forms of Denial of Service attacks. However the very
    reaction to a "False Positive" in the first place may very well reveal more
    detailed information about defences than you might well think.

* [NbtScan](http://www.unixwiz.net/tools/nbtscan.html)

  * This is a command-line tool that scans for open NETBIOS nameservers on a
    local or remote TCP/IP network, and this is a first step in finding of open
    shares. It is based on the functionality of the standard Windows tool
    nbtstat, but it operates on a range of addresses instead of just one. I
    wrote this tool because the existing tools either didn't do what I wanted or
    ran only on the Windows platforms: mine runs on just about everything.

* [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder)

  * Responder an LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner. It will answer to specific
    NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service) queries based on their name suffix (see:
    http://support.microsoft.com/kb/163409). By default, the tool will only
    answer to File Server Service request, which is for SMB. The concept behind
    this is to target our answers, and be stealthier on the network. This also
    helps to ensure that we don't break legitimate NBT-NS behavior. You can set
    the -r option via command line if you want to answer to the Workstation
    Service request name suffix.

* Firewall
* [Firewalk](http://packetfactory.openwall.net/projects/firewalk/)

  * Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to
    determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass.
    Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than
    the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the
    packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an
    ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic,
    it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response. To
    get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the
    gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that
    traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan
    is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan.

* General

* [Nmap](http://nmap.org/)

  * Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for
    network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
    administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory,
    managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
    Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available
    on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are
    offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what
    type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
    characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works
    fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating
    systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and
    Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
    suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data
    transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing
    scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool
    (Nping).

  * Cloud service providers and data centers offer their customers the ability
    to deploy virtual machines within multi-tenant environments. These virtual
    machines are typically connected to the physical network via a virtualized
    network configuration. This could be as simple as a bridged interface to
    each virtual machine or as complicated as a virtual switch providing more
    robust networking features such as VLANs, QoS, and monitoring. In this talk
    I will demonstrate the effects of VLAN hopping, ARP poisoning and
    Man-in-the-Middle attacks across every major hypervisor platform, including
    results of attacks originating from the physically connected network as well
    as within the virtual networks themselves. Each attack category that is
    discussed will be accompanied by a detailed proof of concept demonstration
    of the attack.

  * "Event Tracing for Windows, (ETW), has been around for quite a while now as
    it was introduced in Windows 2000. It's basically instrumented logging that
    describes what a component is doing. Conceptually, it-s something like the
    proverbial printf("here1") concept used by programmers, but it is present in
    retail builds. When you enable logging in a component the result is an ETL
    (Event Trace Log) file. What-s new is that that Network Monitor can read any
    ETL file. And with the supplied parsers many network oriented ETW providers
    can be decoded."

  * C3CM: the acronym for command- control- and communi - cations
    countermeasures. Ripe for use in the information security realm, C3CM takes
    us past C2 analysis and to the next level. Initially, C3CM was most often
    intended to wreck the command and control of enemy air defense networks, a
    very specific military mission. We-ll apply that mindset in the context of
    combating bots and other evil. Our version of C3CM therefore is to identify,
    interrupt, and counter the command, control, and communications capabilities
    of our digital assailants. The three phases of C3CM will utilize: Nfsight
    with Nfdump, Nfsen, and fprobe to conduct our identification phase, Bro with
    Logstash and Kibana for the interruption phase, and ADHD for the counter
    phase. Converge these on one useful platform and you too might have a chance
    deter those who would do you harm. We-ll discuss each of these three phases
    (identify, interrupt, and counter) with tooling and tactics, complete with
    demonstrations and methodology attendees can put to use in their
    environments. Based on the three part ISSA Journal Toolsmith series:
