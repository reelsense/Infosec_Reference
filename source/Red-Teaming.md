  * Dismissing or laughing off concerns about what it does to a person to know
    critical secrets does not lessen the impact on life, work, and relationships
    of building a different map of reality than “normal people” use. One has to
    calibrate narratives to what another believes. One has to live defensively,
    warily. This causes at the least cognitive dissonance which some manage by
    denial. But refusing to feel the pain does not make it go away. It just
    intensifies the consequences when they erupt. Philip K. Dick said, reality
    is that which, when you no longer believe in it, does not go away. When
    cognitive dissonance evolves into symptoms of traumatic stress, one ignores
    those symptoms at one’s peril. But the very constraints of one’s work often
    make it impossible to speak aloud about those symptoms, because that might
    threaten one’s clearances, work, and career. And whistle blower protection
    is often non-existent.

    * Whether or not you are just starting in InfoSec, it is always important to
      remember that mistakes happen, even to the best and most seasoned of
      analysts. The key is to learn from your mistakes and keep going. So, if
      you have a few minutes and want to talk a load off for a bit, come and
      join in as a hillbilly spins a yarn about a group unfortunate pentesters
      and their misadventures. All stories and events are true (but the names
      have been be changed to prevent embarrassment).

  * [Looping Surveillance Cameras through Live Editing - Van Albert and Banks - Defcon23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoOqznZUClI)

    * This project consists of the hardware and software necessary to hijack
      wired network communications. The hardware allows an attacker to splice
      into live network cabling without ever breaking the physical connection.
      This allows the traffic on the line to be passively tapped and examined.
      Once the attacker has gained enough knowledge about the data being sent,
      the device switches to an active tap topology, where data in both
      directions can be modified on the fly. Through our custom implementation
      of the network stack, we can accurately mimic the two devices across
      almost all OSI layers. We have developed several applications for this
      technology. Most notable is the editing of live video streams to produce a
      “camera loop,” that is, hijacking the feed from an Ethernet surveillance
      camera so that the same footage repeats over and over again. More advanced
      video transformations can be applied if necessary. This attack can be
      executed and activated with practically no interruption in service, and
      when deactivated, is completely transparent.

  * [Sniffing Sunlight - Erik Kamerling - ANYCON2017](http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=videos/anycon2017/102-sniffing-sunlight-erik-kamerling)

    * Laser listening devices (laser microphones) are a well understood
      technology. They have historically been used in the surreptitious
      surveillance of protected spaces. Using such a device, an attacker bounces
      an infrared laser off of a reflective surface, and receives the ricocheted
      beam with a photoreceptor. If the beam is reflected from a surface that is
      vibrating due to sound (voice is a typical background target), that sound
      is subsequently modulated into the beam and can be demodulated at the
      receptor. This is a known attack method and will be briefly discussed.
      However, does this principle also hold for non-amplified or naturally
      concentrated light sources? Can one retrieve modulated audio from
      reflected sunlight? The idea of modulating voice with sunlight was
      pioneered by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880 with an invention called the
      Photophone. A Photophone uses the audio modulation concept now used in
      laser microphones, but relied on a concentrated beam of sunlight rather
      than a laser to communicate at distance. Considering that Bell proved that
      intentionally concentrated sunlight can be used to modulate voice, we will
      explore under what natural conditions modulated audio can be found in
      reflected ambient light. Using off the shelf solar-cells and handmade
      amplifiers, Erik will demonstrate the use of the receiver side of a
      historic Photophone to identify instances of modulated audio in reflected
      light under common conditions.

      In this talk, we will reveal ways that we bypass in-line network defenses,
      spam filters (in line and cloud based), as well as current endpoint
      solutions. Some techniques are old, some are new, but all work in helping
      to get a foothold established. Defenders: might want to come to this one.

      these systems can be abused and leveraged to break into corporate
      networks. A penetration testing methodology will be discussed and
      technical demonstrations of attacks will be shown. Phases of this
      methodology include information gathering, network mapping, vulnerability
      identification, penetration, privilege escalation, and maintaining access.
      Methods for organizations to better protect systems will also be
      discussed.

  * WSC2 is a PoC of using the WebSockets and a browser process to serve as a C2
    communication channel between an agent, running on the target system, and a
    controller acting as the actuel C2 server.

### PoCs

* [RemoteRecon](https://github.com/xorrior/RemoteRecon)

  * RemoteRecon provides the ability to execute post-exploitation capabilities
    against a remote host, without having to expose your complete toolkit/agent.
    Often times as operator's we need to compromise a host, just so we can
    keylog or screenshot (or some other miniscule task) against a person/host of
    interest. Why should you have to push over beacon, empire, innuendo,
    meterpreter, or a custom RAT to the target? This increases the footprint
    that you have in the target environment, exposes functionality in your
    agent, and most likely your C2 infrastructure. An alternative would be to
    deploy a secondary agent to targets of interest and collect intelligence.
    Then store this data for retrieval at your discretion. If these compromised
    endpoints are discovered by IR teams, you lose those endpoints and the
    information you've collected, but nothing more.

    collaborative web platform or service. The base docClient and docServer are
    meant to be extended upon with Buffer classes written for individual web
    services. These buffer classes can be plugged into the MurDock framework in
    order to create a unique shell infrastructure that will always contains a
    base set of features, as well as the ability to tunnel over any web
    application traffic for which a buffer class has been constructed. The
    framework can be extended to operate over lower level protocols if desired.

    * Covert channels are used for the secret transfer of information.
      Encryption only protects communication from being decoded by unauthorised
      parties, whereas covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the
      communication. Initially, covert channels were identified as a security
      threat on monolithic systems i.e. mainframes. More recently focus has
      shifted towards covert channels in computer network protocols. The huge
      amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet
      seems ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communication. This
      article is a survey of the existing techniques for creating covert
      channels in widely deployed network and application protocols. We also
      give an overview of common methods for their detection, elimination, and
      capacity limitation, required to improve security in future computer
      networks.

    * In this session, we will reveal and demonstrate perfect exfiltration via
      indirect covert channels (i.e. the communicating parties don’t directly
      exchange network packets). This is a family of techniques to exfiltrate
      data (low throughput) from an enterprise in a manner indistinguishable
      from genuine traffic. Using HTTP and exploiting a byproduct of how some
      websites choose to cache their pages, we will demonstrate how data can be
      leaked without raising any suspicion. These techniques are designed to
      overcome even perfect knowledge and analysis of the enterprise network
      traffic.

      results, the site will instantaneously and irrevocably securely delete
      itself. Visitors can contribute to the public content of the site, these
      contributions will also be destroyed when the site deletes itself.

  * IBM System Z Mainframes are in regular use in Fortune 500 companies. Far
    from being legacy these systems are running an actively maintained operating
    system (z/OS). Applications on these often occupy roles critical to the
    business processes they underpin, with much of the later technology built
    around them, rather than replacing them. However, these systems are often
    bypassed by security testing due to worried of availability or assumptions
    about legacy. This talk will introduce you to assessing mainframe
    applications, which turn out to be quite similar to web applications. For
    this purpose we built a tool, Big Iron Recon & Pwnage (BIRP), to assist with
    performing such assessments. Importantly, our research uncovered a family of
    mainframe application vulnerabilities introduced by the TN3270 protocol. We
    found numerous applications, but not all, vulnerable to these flaws.
    Applications running within the two most popular transaction managers (CICS
    and IMS) as well as one of IBM’s own applications. The tool released assists
    with the exploitation of these flaws.
