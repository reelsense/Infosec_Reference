### General Classes

* [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)

  * Free Coursera Course

  * About this course: This course gives you easy access to the invaluable
    learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math,
    science, sports, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about the how the
    brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates
    (“chunks”) information. We’ll also cover illusions of learning, memory
    techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by
    research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.

* [ENISA CERT Exercises and Training](http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/exercise)

  * ENISA CERT Exercises and training material was introduced in 2008, in 2012
    and 2013 it was complemented with new exercise scenarios containing
    essential material for success in the CERT community and in the field of
    information security. In this page you will find the ENISA CERT Exercise
    material, containing Handbook for teachers, Toolset for students and Virtual
    Image to support hands on training sessions.

* [SEEDLabs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/all_labs.html)

  * People learn from mistakes. In security education, we study mistakes that
    lead to software vulnerabilities. Studying mistakes from the past not only
    help students understand why systems are vulnerable, why a "seemly-benign"
    mistake can turn into a disaster, and why many security mechanisms are
    needed. More importantly, it also helps students learn the common patterns
    of vulnerabilities, so they can avoid making similar mistakes in the future.
    Moreover, using vulnerabilities as case studies, students can learn the
    principles of secure design, secure programming, and security testing.

### Programming Classes/Courses

* [asm - 0xAX](https://github.com/0xAX/asm)

* Learning assembly for linux-x64

* [Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, & Alliteration](http://opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html)

  * This class serves as a foundation for the follow on Intermediate level x86
    class. It teaches the basic concepts and describes the hardware that
    assembly code deals with. It also goes over many of the most common assembly
    instructions. Although x86 has hundreds of special purpose instructions,
    students will be shown it is possible to read most programs by knowing only
    around 20-30 instructions and their variations.

* [Win32 ASM tutorials - Iczelion](http://win32assembly.programminghorizon.com/tutorials.html)

### Reverse Engineering

* [Binary Auditing Training - Thorsten Schneider](http://www.binary-auditing.com/)

  * The training package includes all necessary files to run a complete lecture
    for Binary Auditing and Reverse Code Engineering at university. All files
    are well sorted by topics and with increasing difficulty. You need Windows
    XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 to use this training package. The training
    package does NOT include runnable viruses!

* [exrs - Binary Exploitation/Reverse Engineering Challenge training](https://github.com/wapiflapi/exrs)

  * Exercises for learning Reverse Engineering and Exploitation. All binaries
    for these challenges are ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64.

* [mammon_'s tales to his grandson - Reverse Engineering](https://mammon.github.io/tales/)
* [Software Modeling and Verification - Static Analysis](http://www-i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/i2/spa12/)
* [The Life of Binaries](http://opensecuritytraining.info/LifeOfBinaries.html)

  * Scanning and tokenizing source code.
  * Parsing a grammar.
  * Different targets for x86 assembly object files generation. (E.g.
    relocatable vs. position independent code).
  * Linking object files together to create a well-formed binary.
  * Detailed descriptions of the high level similarities and low level
    differences between the Windows PE and Linux ELF binary formats. (NOTE: we
    didn't get to this in the class where the video was recorded, but the
    materials are in the slides)
    * How an OS loads a binary into memory and links it on the fly before
      executing it.
    * Along the way we discuss the relevance of security at different stages of
      a binary’s life, from the tricks that can be played by a malicious
      compiler, to how viruses really work, to the way which malware “packers”
      duplicate OS process execution functionality, to the benefit of a
      security-enhanced OS loader which implements address space layout
      randomization (ASLR).

* [Modern Binary Exploitation - CSCI 4968 - Spring '15](http://security.cs.rpi.edu/courses/binexp-spring2015/)

  * The course will start off by covering basic x86 reverse engineering,
    vulnerability analysis, and classical forms of Linux based userland binary
    exploitation. It will then transitionin to protections found on modern
    systems(Canaries, DEP, ASLR, RELRO, FortifySource, etc) and the techniques
    used to defeat them.Time permitting, the course will also cover other
    subjects in exploitation including kernel land and Windows based
    exploitation.
